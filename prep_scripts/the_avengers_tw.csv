narrator,"first lines; Loki has allied with the alien race the Chitauri, in exchange for the Tesseract, they agree to help Loki subjugate Earth"
The Other,"[voice over] The Tesseract has awakened. It is on a little world, a human world. They wield its power, but ally is working knows its working, so that they never will learn. Hes ready to lead, and our force, our Chitauri will follow. The world will be his and the universe yours. And the humans, what can they do, but burn?"
narrator,Nick Fury and Maria Hill arrive at a remote research facility during an evacuation
Nick Fury,How bad is it?
Agent Phil Coulson,"Thats the problem, sir. We dont know."
narrator,an elevator goes down
Agent Phil Coulson,Dr. Selvig read an energy surge from the Tesseract four hour ago.
Nick Fury,NASA didnt authorize Selvig to test the Tesseract.
Agent Phil Coulson,"He wasnt testing it, he wasnt even in the room. Spontaneous advancement"
Agent Maria Hill,It just turned itself on?
Nick Fury,What are the reading levels now?
Agent Phil Coulson,"Climbing. When Selvig couldnt shut it down, we ordered the evac."
Nick Fury,How long to get everyone out?
Agent Phil Coulson,Campus should be clear in the next half hour.
Nick Fury,It better.
Agent Maria Hill,"Sir, evacuation maybe futile."
Nick Fury,We should tell them to go back to sleep?
Agent Maria Hill,"If we cant control the Tesseracts energy, there may not be a minimum safe distance."
Nick Fury,I need you to make sure that the phase 2 prototypes are shipped out.
Agent Maria Hill,"Sir, is that really a priority right now?"
Nick Fury,"Until such time as the world ends, we will act as though it intends to spin on. Clear out the tech below. Every piece of phase 2 on a truck and gone."
Agent Maria Hill,"Yes, sir."
narrator,Fury enters the lab facility where the Tesseract is being held
Nick Fury,"Talk to me, doctor."
Selvig,Director.
Nick Fury,Is there anything we know for certain?
Selvig,The Tesseract is misbehaving.
Nick Fury,Is that supposed to be funny?
Selvig,"No, its not funny at all. The Tesseract is not only active, shes...misbehaving."
Nick Fury,How soon until you pull the plug?
Selvig,"Shes an energy source. If we turn off the power, she turns it back on. If she reaches peak level..."
Nick Fury,"Were prepared for this, doctor. Harnessing energy from space."
Selvig,"We dont have the harness. My calculations are far from complete. And shes throwing off interference, radiation. Nothing harmful, low levels of gamma radiation."
Nick Fury,That can be harmful. Wheres Agent Barton?
Selvig,"[he points behind him] The Hawk? Up in his nest, as usual."
narrator,"we see Barton is up on the railings watching them below, Fury calls Barton on his earpiece"
Nick Fury,"Agent Barton, report to."
narrator,Clint slides down a rope
narrator,Clint is then seen walking and talking with Fury
Nick Fury,I gave you this detail so you could keep a close eye on things.
Clint Barton,Well I see better from a distance.
Nick Fury,Are you seeing anything that might set this thing off?
narrator,to Selvig; referring to the reading from the Tesseract
NASA Scientist,"Doctor, its spiking again."
Clint Barton,"No ones come or gone. Its oven is clean. No contacts, no I.M.s. If there was any tampering, sir, it wasnt at this end."
Nick Fury,At this end?
Clint Barton,"Yeah, the cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right? Doors open from both sides."
narrator,"suddenly the Tesseract is activated and opens a portal through space, from which Loki steps through"
Nick Fury,"[to Loki after hes come through the portal] Sir, please put down the spear!"
narrator,Loki looks at his spear then suddenly points it at where Fury and Barton are standing and shoots out a blue exploding light towards them
narrator,"as Barton tries to kill Loki, Loki grabs Bartons hand"
Loki,You have heart.
narrator,Loki points the head of his spear at Bartons hear and uses his ability to control Bartons mind
narrator,"as Loki is busy using his abilities to control the minds of several S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel, Fury takes the Tesseract and tries to leave the lab"
Loki,Please dont. I still need that.
Nick Fury,This doesnt have to get any messier.
Loki,"Of course it does. Ive come too far for anything else. I am Loki of Asgard, and I am burdened with glorious purpose."
Selvig,Loki? Brother of Thor?
Nick Fury,We have no quarrel with your people.
Loki,An ant has no quarrel with a boot.
Nick Fury,You planning to step on us?
Loki,"I come with glad tidings, of a world made free."
Nick Fury,Free from what?
Loki,"Freedom. Freedom is lifes great lie. Once you accept that, in your heart..."
narrator,he turns to face Selvig whos standing behind him and places his spear against Selvigs heart
Loki,You will know peace.
narrator,he uses his abilities to control Selvigs mind
Nick Fury,"Yeah, you say peace, I kind of think you mean the other piece."
Clint Barton,"Sir, Director Fury is stalling. This place is about to blow. Drop a hundred feet of raw material, he means to bury us."
Nick Fury,Like The Pharaohs of old.
Selvig,"Hes right, the portal is collapsing in on itself. You got maybe two minutes before this goes critical."
narrator,Loki commands Barton
Loki,Well then.
narrator,"Barton shoot at Fury who falls to the ground, Barton grabs the case containing the Tesseract and leaves the lab with Loki, Selvig and the other S.H.I.E.L.D personnel Loki is controlling"
narrator,"Loki, Barton, Selvig and the other S.H.I.E.L.D personnel are in the parking lot of the facility"
Clint Barton,We need these vehicles.
Agent Maria Hill,[referring to Loki] Whos that?
Clint Barton,He didnt tell me.
narrator,"Hill looks suspiciously at them as they get into the truck and turns to leave, as shes walking away Fury shouts through the walkie talkie"
Nick Fury,"Hill, do you copy? Barton has turned..."
narrator,"suddenly Hill turns to shoot at Barton but Barton is already pointing his gun at her and starts shooting, he moves the drivers seat of the truck and drives off as Hill keeps shooting"
Nick Fury,Theyve got the Tesseract! Track it down!
narrator,Hill gets into a truck and follows after Bartons truck
narrator,"after the research facility has collapsed, Fury and Hill try to chase after Loki but fail to catch him escaping with the briefcase containing the Tesseract; talking through their walkie talkies"
Agent Phil Coulson,"Director? Director Fury, do you copy?"
Nick Fury,The Tesseract is with the hostile force. I have men down. Hill?
Agent Maria Hill,"A lot of men still under, dont know how many survivors."
Nick Fury,"Sound the general call, I want every living soul not needing rescue looking for that briefcase."
Agent Maria Hill,Roger that.
Nick Fury,"Coulson, get back to base. This is a level seven. As of right now, we are at war."
Agent Phil Coulson,What do we do?
narrator,Fury doesnt answer but remains silent and Marvels The Avengers appears on the screen
narrator,"in Russia, Natasha is being interrogated by some thugs"
Luchkov,This is not how I wanted this night to go.
Natasha Romanoff,"I know how you wanted this night to go. Believe me, this is better."
Luchkov,"Who are you working for? Lermentov, yes? Does he really think that well have to go through him to move our tanks?"
Natasha Romanoff,I thought General Solohob was in charge of the cargo?
Luchkov,Solohob? A bagman. A front.
narrator,one of the thugs phone rings
Thug,Hello? [looks at Luchkov] Its for her.
narrator,he hands Luchkov the phone who takes it
Luchkov,You listen here...
narrator,Coulson calls as Natashas being interrogated by Luchkov and his thugs
Agent Phil Coulson,"We have a missile 5 miles out. Put the woman on the phone, or I will blow up the block before you can make the lobby."
narrator,Luchkov places the cell phone against Natashas ear as shes tied to a chair with her hands tied behind her back
Agent Phil Coulson,We need you to come in.
Natasha Romanoff,Are you kidding? Im working!
Agent Phil Coulson,This takes precedence.
Natasha Romanoff,Im in the middle of an interrogation and this moron is giving me everything.
Georgi Luchkov,I dont give everything.
narrator,Natasha gives him a look
Natasha Romanoff,"Look, you cant pull me out of this right now."
Agent Phil Coulson,"Natasha, Bartons been compromised."
Natasha Romanoff,Let me put you on hold.
narrator,"as Luchkov comes to take the phone off her she hits him with her leg and starts attacking the other thugs, she frees herself from the chair, knocks everyone out, picks up the phone as Coulson is still waiting on the line"
Natasha Romanoff,Wheres Barton now?
Agent Phil Coulson,We dont know.
Natasha Romanoff,But hes alive.
Agent Phil Coulson,"We think so. Ill brief you on everything when you get back. But first, we need you to talk to the big guy."
Natasha Romanoff,"Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me about as far as he can throw me."
Agent Phil Coulson,"No, Ive got Stark. You get the big guy."
narrator,Natasha stops in realization
Natasha Romanoff,Holy cow.
narrator,"in India, after getting lured in by a little girl to a remote location help her sick father and sees that the little girl running away as soon as shes brought him to an isolated building"
Bruce Banner,"Should have got paid up front, Banner."
narrator,Natasha comes up behind him
Natasha Romanoff,"You know, for a man whos supposed to be avoiding stress, you picked a hell of a place to settle."
Bruce Banner,Avoiding stress isnt the secret.
Natasha Romanoff,Then what is it? Yoga?
Bruce Banner,"You brought me to the edge of the city, smart. I uh...assume the whole place is surrounded?"
Natasha Romanoff,Just you and me.
Bruce Banner,"And your actress buddy, is she a spy too? Do they start that young?"
Natasha Romanoff,I did.
Bruce Banner,Who are you?
Natasha Romanoff,Natasha Romanoff.
Bruce Banner,"Are you here to kill me, Miss Romanoff? Because thats not gonna work out for everyone."
Natasha Romanoff,No. No. Of course not. Im here on behalf of SHIELD.
Bruce Banner,SHIELD. How did they find me?
Natasha Romanoff,"We never lost you, doctor. Weve kept our distance, even helped keep some other interested parties off your scent."
Bruce Banner,Why?
Natasha Romanoff,Nick Fury seems to trust you. But now we need you to come in.
Bruce Banner,What if I say no?
Natasha Romanoff,Ill persuade you.
Bruce Banner,And what if the...other guy says no?
Natasha Romanoff,Youve been more than a year without an incident. I dont think you wanna break that streak.
Bruce Banner,I dont get every time what I want.
Natasha Romanoff,"Doctor, were facing a potential global catastrophe."
Bruce Banner,"Well, those I actively try to avoid."
Natasha Romanoff,This is the Tesseract.
narrator,she shows him a photo of the Tesseract on her cell phone
Natasha Romanoff,It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet.
Bruce Banner,What does Fury want me to do? Swallow it?
Natasha Romanoff,"Well, he wants you to find it. Its been taken. It omits a gamma signature thats too weak for us to trace. Theres no one that knows gamma radiation like you do. If there was, thats where Id be."
Bruce Banner,So Fury isnt after the monster?
Natasha Romanoff,Not that hes told me.
Bruce Banner,And he tells you everything?
Natasha Romanoff,"Talk to Fury, he needs you on this."
Bruce Banner,He needs me in a cage?
Natasha Romanoff,No ones gonna put you in a...
narrator,suddenly Banner gets angry and snaps
Bruce Banner,Stop lying to me!
narrator,Natasha quickly grab her gun and points it at Banner
Bruce Banner,"Im sorry, that was mean. I just wanted to see what youd do. Why dont we do this the easy way, where you dont use that, and the other guy doesnt make a mess? Okay?"
narrator,"Natasha, still wary, doesnt lower her gun"
Bruce Banner,Natasha.
narrator,she lowers her gun and speaks into her earpiece to the SHIELD agents who are surrounding the building outside
Natasha Romanoff,Stand down. Were good here.
narrator,Banner looks at Natasha in amusement
Bruce Banner,Just you and me?
narrator,Fury is facing several large monitors as he as a conference with the world security council
World Security Council #1,"This is out of line, Director. Youre dealing with forces you cant control."
Nick Fury,"You ever been in a war, Councilman? In a firefight? Did you feel an over abundance of control?"
World Security Council #1,You saying that this Asgard has declared war on our planet?
Nick Fury,Not Asgard. Loki.
World Security Council #2,He cant be working alone. What about the other one? His brother.
Nick Fury,"Our intelligence says, Thor is not a hostile. But hes worlds away, we cant depend on him to help either. Its up to us."
World Security Council #1,"Which is why you should be focusing on phase 2, it was designed for exactly..."
Nick Fury,"Phase 2 isnt ready, our enemy is. We need a response team."
World Security Council #1,The Avengers Initiative was shut down.
Nick Fury,This isnt about The Avengers. We need a response team.
World Security Council #1,Were running the worlds greatest covert security network and youre gonna leave the fate of human race to a handful of freaks.
Nick Fury,"Im not leaving anything to anyone. We need a response team. These people may be isolated, unbalanced even, but I believe with the right push they can be exactly what we need."
World Security Council #2,You believe?
World Security Council #1,"War isnt won by sentiment, Director."
Nick Fury,"No, its won by soldiers."
narrator,"Steve is pummeling a punching bag in a gym, as he remembers how he ended up getting frozen in the ocean, he becomes angry and knocks the punching bag off its chain, as he picks up another, Fury walks in"
Nick Fury,Trouble sleeping?
Steve Rogers,"I slept for seventy years, sir. I think Ive had my fill."
Nick Fury,"Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world."
Steve Rogers,"I went under, the world was at war, I wake up, they say we won. They didnt say what we lost."
Nick Fury,Weve made some mistakes along the way. Some very recently.
Steve Rogers,"You here with a mission, sir?"
Nick Fury,I am.
Steve Rogers,Trying to get me back in the world?
Nick Fury,Trying to save it.
narrator,Fury gives Steve the file on Tesseract to look at
Steve Rogers,Hydras secret weapon.
Nick Fury,"Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you. He thought what we think, the Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy. Thats something the world sorely needs."
Steve Rogers,Who took it from you?
Nick Fury,Hes called Loki. Hes not from around here. Theres a lot well have to bring you up to speed on if youre in. The world has gotten even stranger than you already know.
Steve Rogers,"At this point, I doubt anything would surprise me."
Nick Fury,Ten bucks says youre wrong.
narrator,Steve turns and picks up a punching bag
Nick Fury,Theres a debriefing package waiting for you back at your apartment.
narrator,"with the punching bag on his shoulder, Steve starts walking out of the gym"
Nick Fury,Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract that we ought to know now?
Steve Rogers,You should have left it in the ocean.
narrator,Stark in his Iron Man suit is working on getting his energy line to work
Tony Stark,Youre good to go on this end. The rest is up to you.
Pepper Potts,You disconnected the transition lines? Are we off the grid?
Tony Stark,Stark Towers is about to become a beacon of of self sustaining clean energy.
Pepper Potts,"Wow, so maybe our reactor takes over and it actually works?"
Tony Stark,I assume. Light her up.
narrator,"as Stark is flying in his suit, we see a large skyscraper building with the name STARK lit up in lights"
Pepper Potts,How does it look?
Tony Stark,"Like Christmas, but with more...me."
Pepper Potts,"Gotta go wider on the public awareness campaign. You need to do some press. I can do some more tomorrow, Im working on the zoning for the next billboards."
Tony Stark,"Pepper, youre killing me. Remember? Enjoy the moment."
narrator,as Stark arrives at his skyscraper penthouse and is in the process of taking off his Iron Man suit
Jarvis,"Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the line."
Tony Stark,Im not in. Im actually out.
Jarvis,"Sir, Im afraid hes insisting."
Tony Stark,Close the line Jarvis. I got a date.
narrator,inside
Pepper Potts,Levels are holding steady...I think.
Tony Stark,"Of course they are, I was directly involved. Which brings me to my next question. How does it feel to be a genius?"
Pepper Potts,"Well, ha, I really wouldnt know now, would I?"
Tony Stark,"What do you mean? All this, came from you."
Pepper Potts,"No. All this, came from that."
narrator,she points to the energy in his chest plate
Tony Stark,"Give yourself some credit, please. Stark Tower is your baby. Give yourself... twelve percent of the credit."
Pepper Potts,Twelve percent?
Tony Stark,An argument can be made for fifteen.
Pepper Potts,Twelve percent for my baby?
Tony Stark,"Well, I did do all the heavy lifting. Literally, I lifted the heavy things. And sorry, but the security snafu? That was on you."
Pepper Potts,Oooooh!
Tony Stark,My private elevator.
Pepper Potts,You mean our elevator?
Tony Stark,"It was teeming with sweaty workmen. Im going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later on, arent I?"
Pepper Potts,Not gonna be that subtle.
Tony Stark,Ill tell you what. Next building is gonna say Potts on the tower.
Pepper Potts,On the lease.
Tony Stark,"Call your mom, can you bunk over?"
narrator,as Stark and Pepper are celebrating the lighting up of Starks Tower
Jarvis,"Sir, the telephone. Im afraid my protocols are being overwritten. [Coulsons voice can be heard through Starks phone]"
Agent Phil Coulson,"Stark, we need to talk. [Stark picks up his phone and looks into it at Coulson]"
Tony Stark,"You have reached the life model decoy of Tony Stark, please leave a message."
Agent Phil Coulson,This is urgent.
Tony Stark,Then leave it urgently. [at that moment the elevator door opens and Coulson appears] Security breach. [to Pepper] Thats on you.
Agent Phil Coulson,Mr. Stark.
Pepper Potts,Phil! Come in.
Tony Stark,Phil?
Agent Phil Coulson,I cant stay.
Tony Stark,Uh...his first name is Agent.
Pepper Potts,"[to Coulson] Come on in, were celebrating."
Pepper Potts,"Come on in, were celebrating."
Tony Stark,Which is why he cant stay.
Agent Phil Coulson,We need you to look this over. [he holds out a file towards Stark] Soon as possible.
Tony Stark,I dont like being handed things.
Pepper Potts,"Thats alright, cause I love to be handed things. So, lets trade. [she passes her glass of champagne to Coulson and takes the file from him, then takes her champagne glass back from Coulson and passes the file over to Stark] Thank you."
Tony Stark,Official consulting hours are between eight and five every other Thursday.
Agent Phil Coulson,This isnt a consultation.
Pepper Potts,Is this about The Avengers? Which I...I know nothing about.
Tony Stark,"The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought. And I didnt even qualify."
Pepper Potts,I didnt know that either.
Tony Stark,"Yeah, apparently Im volatile, self obsessed, dont play well with others."
Pepper Potts,That I did know.
Agent Phil Coulson,This isnt about personality profiles anymore.
Tony Stark,"Whatever. Miss Potts, got a minute? You know, I thought we were having a moment."
Pepper Potts,"I was having twelve percent of a moment. This seems serious, Phils pretty shaken."
Tony Stark,How did you notice? Why is he Phil? [referring to the file Coulson had given to Stark]
Pepper Potts,What is all this?
Tony Stark,This is uh... [with a flick of his hand he spreads all the profiles of the other Avengers on to the different computer screens] This. [Pepper looks at all their profiles in awe]
Pepper Potts,Im going to take the jet to D.C. tonight.
Tony Stark,Tomorrow.
Pepper Potts,You have homework. You have a lot of homework.
Tony Stark,"Well, what if I didnt?"
Pepper Potts,If you didnt?
Tony Stark,Yeah.
Pepper Potts,"You mean if you finished? [Stark nods his head] Well, um...then [she whispers something in his ear and Coulson looks away in embarrassment]"
Tony Stark,Square deal. Its the last date. [Pepper kisses him]
Pepper Potts,Work hard. [looking at the Banners file]
Steve Rogers,So this Dr. Banner was trying to replicate the serum that was used on me?
Agent Phil Coulson,A lot of people were. You were the worlds first superhero. Banner thought gammer radiation might hold the key to unlocking Erskines original formula.
Steve Rogers,"Didnt really go his way, did it?"
Agent Phil Coulson,"Not so much. When hes got that thing though, guys like a Stephen Hawking. [Steve looks at Coulson in confusion] Hes like a smart person. I gotta say, its an honor to meet you, officially. I sort of met you, I mean, I watched you while you were sleeping. [Steve looks at Coulson in amusement] I mean, I was...I was present while you were unconscious from the ice. You know, its really, its just a...just a huge honor to have you on board."
Steve Rogers,"Well, I hope Im the man for the job."
Agent Phil Coulson,"Oh, you are. Absolutely. Uh...weve made some modifications to the uniform. I had a little design input."
Steve Rogers,The uniform? Arent the stars and stripes a little...old fashioned?
Agent Phil Coulson,"Everything thats happening, the things that are about to come to light, people might just need a little old fashioned."
The Other,The Chitauri grow restless.
Loki,Let them grow restless. I will lead them in the glorious battle.
The Other,Battle? Against a meagre might of earth?
Loki,"Glorious, not lengthy. If your force is as formidable as you claim."
The Other,"You question us? Question him? He who put the scepter in your hand? Who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose? When you were cast out, defeated!"
Loki,I was a king! The rightful king of Asgard. Betrayed.
The Other,Your ambition is little and full of childish need. Were beyond the earth to greater worlds. The Tesseract will avail.
Loki,"You dont have the Tesseract yet. [suddenly The Other moves towards Loki] I dont threaten. But until I open the doors, until your force is mine to command, you are but words."
The Other,"If you fail, if the Tesseract is kept from us, there will be no realm, no barren moon, no crevasse where I cant find you. You think you know pain? He will make you long for that so sweet as pain. [after Coulson brings Steve to the Helicarrier, which is a high-tech, flying aircraft carrier]"
Natasha Romanoff,"There was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice. I thought Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet?"
Steve Rogers,Trading cards?
Natasha Romanoff,"Theyre vintage, hes very proud."
Steve Rogers,Dr. Banner. [Banner shakes hands with Steve]
Bruce Banner,"Oh, yeah. Hi. They told me youd be coming."
Steve Rogers,Word is you can find the cube.
Bruce Banner,Is that the only word on me?
Steve Rogers,Only word I care about.
Bruce Banner,"Must be strange for you, all of this."
Steve Rogers,"Well, this is actually kind of familiar."
Natasha Romanoff,"Gentlemen, you may wanna step inside in a minute. Its gonna get a little hard to breath. [suddenly the Helicarrier starts shaking as it prepares to fly]"
Steve Rogers,Is this is a submarine?
Bruce Banner,"Really? They wanted me in a submerged pressurized metal container? [they both move closer to the edge of the Helicarrier and watch in awe as it starts to lift into the air] Oh, no. This is much worse."
Nick Fury,"[to Steve and Banner after they watch in awe as the Helicarrier takes off and off] Gentlemen. [Steve gives Fury 10 bucks, referring to his earlier statement about never being surprised again] Doctor, thank you for coming."
Bruce Banner,"Thanks for asking nicely. So, uh...how long am I staying?"
Nick Fury,"Once we get our hands on the Tesseract, youre in the clear."
Bruce Banner,Where are you with that? [Fury points to Coulson to explain]
Agent Phil Coulson,"Were sweeping every wirelessly accessible camera on the planet. Cell phones, laptops. If its connected to a satellite, its eyes and ears for us."
Natasha Romanoff,Thats still not gonna find them in time.
Bruce Banner,You have to narrow the field. How many spectrometers do you have access to?
Nick Fury,How many are there?
Bruce Banner,"Call every lab you know, tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for gamma rays. Ill rough out a tracking algorithm based on cluster recognition. At least we could rule out a few places. Do you have somewhere for me to work?"
Nick Fury,"Agent Romanoff, would you show Dr. Banner to his laboratory, please."
Natasha Romanoff,"Youre gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys. [still under Lokis mind control, Selvig and Barton are working on the Tesseract in some remote laboratory]"
Selvig,Where did you find all these people?
Clint Barton,"SHIELD has not shortage of enemies, Doctor. [he holds up a screen showing information in Iridium] Is this the stuff you need?"
Selvig,"Yeah, Iridium. Its found in meteorites, it forms anti-protons. Its very hard to get hold of."
Clint Barton,Specially if SHIELD knows you need it.
Selvig,"Well, I didnt know! The Tesseract is showing me so much. Its...its more than knowledge, its truth."
Loki,"I know. What did it show you, Agent Barton?"
Clint Barton,My next target.
Loki,Tell me what you need. [Barton gets his bow]
Clint Barton,I need a distraction. And an eyeball. [as they are waiting to locate Loki using satellite facial recognition]
Agent Phil Coulson,"I mean, if its not too much trouble."
Steve Rogers,"No, no. Its fine."
Agent Phil Coulson,"Its a vintage set. It took me a couple of years to collect them all. Near mint, slight foxing around the edges, but..."
Agent Jasper Sitwell,"We got a hit. Sixty seven percent match. Weight, cross match, seventy nine percent."
Agent Phil Coulson,Location?
