narrator,looking at a beautiful woman in a bar
charles,heterochromia.
amy,a gentlemen would at least offer to buy me a drink first.
narrator,charles turns to the barman
charles,"(chuckles) norman, pint of bitter for me and brandy for the lady, please."
amy,how did you know that?
charles,lucky guess. names xavier. charles xavier. how do you do?
amy,amy.
charles,"heterochromica was in reference to your eyes, which i have to say are stunning. one green, one blue. its a mutation. its a very groovy mutation. ive got news for you, amy. you are a mutant."
amy,"first you proposition a girl, and then you call her deformed. how is that seduction technique working for you?"
charles,ill tell you in the morning.
narrator,amy smiles and charles laughs
charles,"no, no, seriously, though, you mustnt knock it. mutation took us from single-celled organisms to being the dominant form of reproductive life of this planet, infinite forms of variation with each generation, all through mutation."
amy,"then, lets reclaim that word. mutant and proud."
charles,chin-chin. hey.
narrator,"raven, who was watching and listening, walks over and is clearly jealous"
raven,hi. guess i have to buy my own drink.
charles,im sorry. one cola.
amy,[to raven] charles here was just tell me that im like one of the first sea creatures that grew legs.
charles,tiny bit sexier.
amy,(chuckles)
charles,im sorry. this is my sister raven.
raven,hi.
amy,amy. and what do you study?
raven,waitressing.
amy,ah.
narrator,raven turns one of her eyes to their natural yellow color
amy,"oh, look, you have heterochromia, too."
charles,sorry. what?
amy,look at her eye.
narrator,he looks at raven and notices what shes done
charles,"(clears throat) [annoyed] right. raven, get your coat, please. dont talk me. you did on purpose."
raven,i did not.
charles,yes you did.
raven,"why would i do it on purpose? you know i cant control it sometimes, if im stressed or im tired."
charles,you seem to be doing a perfectly good job right now.
raven (imitating amy),"""mutant and proud."""
charles,what?
raven,"or is that only with pretty mutations or invisible ones, like yours. but if youre a freak, better hide."
charles,"youre being ridiculous. look, look, i dont mean to sound like an old fart."
raven,which you are.
charles,"sometimes. but weve talked about this, raven. a small slipup is one thing. a big one does not beer thinking about."
raven,[to herself] mutant and proud. mutant and proud? (spits) if only. would you date me?
charles,of course i would. any young would be lucky to have you. you are stunning.
raven,looking like this?
charles,like... what? blue? youre my oldest friend.
raven,im your only friend.
charles,thank you for that.
raven,well?
charles,im incapable of thinking of you that way. youre... i feel responsible for you. anything else would just feel wrong.
raven,but what if you didnt know me?
charles,"unfortunately, i do know you. god, i dont know whats gotten into you lately. youre awfully concerned with your looks."
raven,im sleepy. will you read to me?
charles,cant. i have my thesis coming up. i have to study.
raven,"well, fine. read that. your thesis always sends me right off."
charles,"""homo neanderthalensis, his mutant cousin, homo sapien,"" was an aberration. ""peaceful cohabtation, if ever it existed, was short-lived. ""records show without execption that the arrival of mutated human species in any region was followed by the immediate extinction of theor less evolved kin..."""
narrator,eric goes into a french bank
nazi guy,possession of that gold is illegal. i should inform the police.
erik,lets not play this game.
nazi guy,where did you get it?
erik,"a friend. he recommended, your bank most highly."
nazi guy,"i see. do you know our terms, sir?"
erik,yes. and you should know mine. this is what remains of my people.
nazi guy,melted from their possessions. torn from their teeth.
erik,this is blood money. and youre going to help me find the bastards responsible for it. (clicking tongue)
nazi guy,(grunts)
erik,dont touch that alarm. i want schmidt. klaus schmidt. where is he?
nazi guy,our clients dont provide addresses. were not...
erik,not that sort of bank?
nazi guy,(gasps)
erik,"metal fillings, eh? not gold? worried someone might steal them?"
nazi guy,argentina! schmidt is in argentina! villa gesell! please! (groaning) (panting)
erik,thank you. i would love to kill you. so mark my words. if you warn anyone im coming... ...i will find you. (in las vegas)
man (sighs),another day at the office.
woman,is that colonel hendry?
man,the nato guy?
woman,yeah.
man,"yes, it is. cause thats three mob bosses, the italian ambassador and the ceo of lockhead."
woman,"they cant all be communists. this hellfire club, its got to be something else."
man,"(chuckles) do you see that? hello, girls. wow. very, nice. what... what are you doing?"
woman,using some equipment the cia didnt give me. stay put.

man,"hey, baby. you want to find a quiet place?"
woman,im so sorry. ive been booked by colonel hendry. excuse me.
shaw,"are you sure we cant get you a refill, bob?"
bob,no.
shaw,so i hear you blocked the proposal to position jupiter missiles in turkey. i expext youll reconsider.
bob,"weve had this conversation. you put our nukes in turkey or anywhere that close to russia, and youre looking at war. nuclear war."
bob,the only thing i will reconsider is having another glass of that delicious champagne. what the hell did you out in my drink? (groans)
woman,(gasps)
emma frost (echoing),"youre thinking of running, hiding. wed find you, hendry. theres not a fortress in the world that could keep us out."
shaw,"magnificent, isnt she, bob? genetic mutation. the evolution of the human genome. wheres azazel? ah. we dont want the colonel to be late."
azazel,comrade.
general,"missiles in turkey send a very clear message. we ever decide to fire them, the russian early warning system wont even have time to kick in."
senator,"this better be important, mactaggert. whoa, whoa, whoa. slow down. you smoking them funny cigarettes?"
woman,"people dont disappear. colonel hendry was there. he was there, mccone, in the hellfire club."
senator,colonel hendry?
colonel hendry,"i agree with you, general. ive reconsidered my position and i now believe we should put jupiter missiles in turkey."
senator,"colonel hendry is here. so unless he magically traveled 3, 000 miles in the last ten minutes, listen to me, i suggest that you stop wasting my time."
guy,looks like hendry wants to start world war iii.
senator,"i got bigger things to deal with right now, mactaggert."
woman,"sir, i... god."
man,"have you lost your mind? so, well, now what?"
woman,we find an expert on genetic mutation.
man,"professor of genetics, charles francis xavier."
raven,"so, how does it feel to be a professor?"
charles,"oh, dont call me that. you dont get to be called professor until you actually have a teaching position."
raven,"i know, but it suits you."
charles,"oh, dont say that. do say ""lets go have a drink,"" though."
raven,lets go havea drink.
charles,wonderful.
erik,"afternoon, gentlemen. hot out there. beer, please. german beer."

erik,(laughs)
narrator,"meets the two german nazis at a bar villa gesell, argentina"
guy,tailor. since i was a boy. my father made the finest suits in dusseldorf.
erik,my parents were from dusseldorf. what was their name? they didnt have a name. it was taken away from them... by pig farmers... ...and tailors. [reading the inscription written on the knife that hes just taken from the 1st german] blood and honor. which would you care to shed first?
guy,we were under orders.
erik,blood then. [he stabs the knife into the germans hand]
guy,(screams)
narrator,after hes killed the barman and the 2nd german using his powers
man,"freeze, asshole."
tailor,"come on, shoot."
guy,(screams) who... what are you?
erik,"lets just say im frankensteins monster. [he gets up and walks over to look at the photo of shaw mounted on the wall] and im looking for my creator. [using his power he gets the gun from the dead barman, turns and shoots the 1st german]"

moira,moira mactaggert.
charles,charles xavier.
moira,do you have a minute?
charles,"for a pretty little bean with a mutated mcr-one gone, i have five. i say mcr-one, you would say auburn hair. its a mutation. its a very groovy mutation. mutation, right, took us from single-called organisms to the dominant form of..."
moira,"you know what? the routine may go over great with the co-eds, but i-im here on business."
charles,what?
moira,i really need your help.
charles,all right.
moira,he kind of mutations that you were talking about in your thesis-- i need to know if they may have already happened. in people alive today. [charles reads her mind seeing the mutants shes seen] professor? i think we should just talk when youre sober. do you have any time tomorrow?
charles,"something tells me you already know the answer to your question. this is very important to me, and if i can help you, i will do my utmost."
moira,thank you.
shaw,"still drinking champagne, bob?"
bob,i will pass.
shaw,"okay, well, so much for the pleasantries. i was wondering... who you told about our little arrangement."
bob,no one.
emma frost,hes telling the truth.
shaw,"good. well, i guess were done here. lets wrap things up, shall we?"
bob,"oh, i know better than to trust you. now, you let me walk out of here with my money or i will pull this pin and we all die."
shaw,go ahead. pull it.
bob,"ill do it, i swear to god."
shaw,but i will.
narrator,as he watches shaw absorb the energy from the bomb
bob,youre on of them?
shaw,"very asttute of you, colonel hendry. you want to guess what i can do? ive got the power to absorb energy-- keeps me young. thats the boring part. the fun stuff is what i can do with it once ive got it. [he touches hendry and sets him on fire]"
charles,the advent of the nuclear age may have accelerated the mutation process. individuals with extraordinary abilities may already be among us. thank you very much.
senator,"mactaggert, you really think that some crackpot scientist is gonna make me believe in. sparkly dames and vanishing men? you just brought yourself a one-way ticket back to the typing pool. this meeting is over."
narrator,moira gets up
charles,"uh, please sit down, agent mactaggert. i didnt really expect you to believe me, given that all you could think about during my presentation was what sort of pie they were serving in the commissary. its apple pecan. i haven;t been entirely honest with you, love, im sorry. you see, one of the many spectacular things my mutation allows me to do is that i can read your mind. "
agent stryker,ive seen this before in a magic show. are you gonna ask us to think of a number between one and ten now?
charles,"(chuckles) no, agent stryker. although, oi could ask you about your son, william, who you were thinking about, which is very nice. but i think id rather ask you about the jupiter missiles america re currently placing in turkey."
senator,hes a goddamn spy. you brought a goddamned spy into this facility!
moira,i did not.
all,(clamoring)
charles,hows that for a magic trick?
man in black,best ive ever seen.
senator,i want them out of here. and locked down until i can figure out what to do.
man in black,my facility is off-site. ill take em.
moira,"i cant believe this. you think the director of the cia would have a little more composure. we should be going after shaw right now, but instead hes up three worring about the wrong mutants. what are we gonna do, levene? levene? levene, whats wrong with you?"
charles,"absolutely nothing. ive just frozen him for a moment cause id like to talk to you. its good, isnt it? im as interested in this sebastian shaw as you are. and if you still want my help, meet me on the third floor of the parking garage."
man in black,"ive always known that there were people like you out there. ive been the laughingstock of this agency for years, but i knew it. youre gonna love my facility."
charles,thats gonna have to wait.
man in black,why?
charles,"agent mactaggert has a lead on sebastion shaw, and if we dont move now, apparently, were gonna lose him."
man in black,what?!
raven,"not only can he read minds, he can communicate with them as well."
narrator,moira pulls up towards them in her car and raven gets in
charles,moira and i have just had a lovely conversation.
moira,"yes, we did."
man in black,that is incredible!
charles,(laughs)
man in black,but... i-i cannot take you anywhere else without permission from upstairs.
charles,would you like to see one more magic trick?
man in black,okay.
charles,[using his power] get in the car.
man in black,good idea.
erik,herr doktor.
shaw,(speaks german) little erik lehnnsherr.
emma frost,hes here to kill you.
erik,(groans)
shaw,what kind of greeting is that?
erik,(groans)
shaw,...after all three years? emma... (clicking tongue) we dont harm our own kind. ah! now its a party.
man (on megaphone),this is the u.s. coast guard. do not attempt to move your vessel. stay where you are.
emma frost,they have a telepath.
narrator,as emma frost stops him using his powers
charles,ive lost shaw. ive lo-- ive lost shaw. th-theres something blocking me. this has never happened to me before. i think theres someone like me on that ship.
moira,like you?
charles,"uh, im sorry, a telepath. this is incredible. i could actually feel her inside my head. im very sorry, but i dont think im gonna be much help to you tonight. youre on your own. oh, my god."
moira,jesus.
man in black,get inside.
charles,"stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop."
moira,(panting) charles? are you okay?
charles,theres someone else out there. there.
shaw,time to go.
erik,(grunts) (metal groaning)
charles,"let go! you have to let it go! you got to hep him. you got to put someone in the water to help him. let it go! you have to let it go! [as he jumps into the sea he speaks to erik with his mind trying to stop him from killing shaw] you cant. youll drown. you have to let go. i know what this means to you, but youre going to die. please, erik, calm your mind."
erik,(gasping) get off me! get off me!
charles,calm down. just breathe. were here!
narrator,after charles has stopped erik from trying to kill shaw
erik,who are you?
charles,my names charles xavier.
erik,you were in my head. how did you do it?
charles,"you have your tricks, i have mine. im like you. just calm your mind."
erik,(panting) i thought i was alone.
charles,"youre not alone. erik, youre not alone."
man in black,welcome to my facility. my mission has been to investigate the application of paranormal powers in military defense.
erik,or offense.
man in black,"this guy shaw, schmidt, whatever you want to call him-- hes working with the russians. we might need your help to stop him."
charles,"marvelous. so we are to be the cias new mutant division, yes?"
man in black,something like that.
hank,"its, uh, supersonic. the most advanced plane ever built. you should see it in real life. its incredible."
man in black,"hank, these are the special new recruits i was telling you about. [to the others] this is hank mccoy, one of our talented young researchers."
charles,how wonderful. another mutant already here. [he goes to shake hanks hand] why didnt you say?
man in black,say what?
charles,because you dont know. [turning to hank]
hank,"i am so, so terribly sorry."
man in black,hank?
hank,"you didnt ask, so i didnt tell."
raven,"so, your mutation is what? youre super smart?"
charles,ill say. hank here graduated harvard at the age of 15.
hank,i wish that all it was.
charles,"youre among friends now, hank. you can show off. [hank takes off his shoes and sock to reveal the mutation on his feet] (chucking) splendid."
hank,im sorry.
charles,"yup, you... (laughter)"
hank,ta-da!
raven,youre amazing.
hank,really? (gromyko speaking russian on tv)
newsman,"""the presence of u.s. missiles in turkey represents an unprecedented threat to the people of the soviet union, "" warned russian foreign minister gromyko earlier today. but he was quick to insist the russians would not be the first to initiate any military action."
shaw,"yeah, well fox that as soon as we get to russia."
emma frost,unless the cia find us first.
shaw,"ill take care of them, too."
emma frost,"if that telepath gets inside your head, he wont be as much fin as i am."
shaw,"already in hand, my love. [he gets up and goes to open a box and takes out a metal looking helmet] the russians... ...made me this. [he puts on the helmet] so, what am i thinking?[emma tries to read his mind but the metal helmet stops her getting access]"
emma frost,i dont know.
shaw,(chuckles) i was thinking that you are the most exquisite thing ive ever seen in my life. and that this needs ice. [pointing to his glass] fetch me some. theres a good girl.
hank,"i-i promised myself id find a cure, ever since i was a little boy. you have no idea what id give to feel..."
narrator,at the same time
raven & hank,normal. [the both smile] (chuckle)
raven,"charles has never understood. hes different, but hes never had to hide. hank, this serum that youre making, it doesnt affect abilities, right? just appearance? normalizes it."
hank,yeah.
raven,do you think it would work on me?
hank,"well, i-i can look into it, if youd like. i mean, its the least i can do after asking you to come down here with such a weird request."
raven,"(chuckles) well, i have to admit, usually when guys ask me out, theyre not after my blood."
hank,"uh, s-sorry. i-i didnt intend to be forward. i was just-- i was excited. you know, uh, the-the nature of your mutation. if any genes hold the key to changing appearance, i-its yours."
raven,"hank, you werent being forward. thats kind of what i meant."
hank,no. but im just sorry if you thought i was.
raven,and im sorry that you werent. [raven moves closer to hank] go ahead. take the blood.
narrator,he injects her with the needle to take blood and she winces from the pain
