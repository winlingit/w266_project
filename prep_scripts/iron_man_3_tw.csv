narrator,"1999, berns, switzerland - we see flashback where tony is at a new years eve party"
happy hogan,[to maya] half hour till the ball drops.
tony stark,"hey, do you want...?"
part guest,"tony stark, great speech, man!"

tony stark,"its my favorite kind, a winning combo."
narrator,tony gets hold of mayas arm and they start walking away
maya hansen,where are we going?
tony stark,"uh...to town on each other, probably back in your room. cause i also wanna see your research."
maya hansen,"okay, you can see my research, but thats...im not gonna show you my town."
narrator,as tony and maya are walking away a man intercepts them
ho yinsen,"mr. stark, ho yinsen."
tony stark,"oh, i finally met a man called ho."
narrator,tony and yinsen shake hands; tony turns to maya
tony stark,come here.
ho yinsen,"i would like to introduce you to our guest, dr. wu."

tony stark,"[to wu] oh, this guy."
dr. wu,mr. stark.
tony stark,hey.
narrator,stark and wu shake hands
tony stark,"youre a heart doctor. shes going to need a cardiologist, fia."
narrator,"tony turns, starts blowing on his party horn and walks away with maya"
maya hansen,bye.
ho yinsen,perhaps another time.
tony stark,"[voice over] it started in berns, switzerland, 1999, the old days. i never thought theyd come back to bite me. why would they?"
narrator,as tony and maya walk towards the elevator an enthusiastic man with long hair comes up towards them
aldrich killian,"mr. stark! oh, wow! hey, tony! aldrich killian. [to maya] im a big fan of your work!"
maya hansen,my work?
tony stark,who isnt? she needs me.
aldrich killian,"well, of course. but, miss hansen, my organization has been tracking your research since year two of mit."
narrator,"tony, maya and hogan walk into the elevator"
happy hogan,"yeah, were full."
narrator,"hogan puts his arms out to stop aldrich from coming inside, but he ducks under hogans arms and moves into the elevator"
tony stark,"oh, wow. he made it. he made the cut."
happy hogan,"what floor are you going to, pal?"
aldrich killian,"oh, now, that is an appropriate question. the ground floor, actually. ive got a proposal im putting together with myself. its a privately funded think tank called, advanced idea mechanics."
narrator,he holds out two business cards towards tony and maya
maya hansen,okay.
narrator,maya takes the cards
tony stark,uh...shell take both. one to throw away and one to not call.
aldrich killian,"advanced idea mechanics, or aim for short."
narrator,he points to the logo on his t-shirt
aldrich killian,do you get it?
tony stark,"i see that, cause its on your t-shirt."
aldrich killian,oh!
tony stark,"[to the party of women in the elevator; referring to hogan as they walk out] ladies, follow the mullet."
maya hansen,"[to aldrich as she walks out of the elevator] thank you, ill call you."
narrator,"as everyone walks out of the elevator, tony stops aldrich from getting out by putting out his arm in front of him"
tony stark,im titillated by the notion of working with you.
aldrich killian,yeah?
tony stark,"yeah, cheese clown. im going to ditch these clowns; ill see you up on the roof in five minutes."
narrator,tony steps out of the elevator
tony stark,im just going to try to get my beef wet real quick. you know what im talkin about?
aldrich killian,okay. ill see you up there.
narrator,the elevator door closes
tony stark,damn betcha. come on! i thought that was just a theory.
maya hansen,"well, it was. if im right, we can access the area of the brain that governs repair."
narrator,we see they are looking at a computer monitor with graph of the brain
tony stark,wow.
maya hansen,and chemically recode it.
tony stark,thats incredible. essentially youre hacking into the genetic operating system...
maya hansen,genetic operating system...
tony stark,...of an organism.
maya hansen,exactly. yes.
tony stark,wow.
narrator,hogan touches mayas plant
maya hansen,can you...
happy hogan,what?
maya hansen,can you not touch my plant. its not...she doesnt like it. she prefers...
tony stark,shes not like the others.
maya hansen,interference is better.
tony stark,[to maya] come on. lets go in the bedroom.
maya hansen,"thats cute, but..."
tony stark,"happy, leave her ficus alone."
narrator,maya turns to hogan
maya hansen,"no, seriously dont."
narrator,as they walk into the bedroom
tony stark,so youre starting with plants?
maya hansen,"for now, yeah. im calling it extremis."
narrator,"as they enter the room, hogan touches her plant and pulls some of the leaves off"
narrator,tony and maya continue talking about her research in the bedroom
maya hansen,"well, its...human application."
tony stark,human application.
maya hansen,exactly! exactly. its dentra-degree vitalization.
tony stark,its revolutionary.
maya hansen,disease prevention...
tony stark,it can change the world.
narrator,"as maya and tony are talking we see her plant, where hogan had ripped of the leaf and stem, start to regenerate"
maya hansen,even limb regrowth.
tony stark,youre the most gifted woman ive ever met.
maya hansen,wow!
tony stark,uh...in switzerland.
maya hansen,"mm, thats better."
tony stark,youre sweet.
maya hansen,"wow, youre seeing things."
narrator,"maya takes off tonys glasses, tony laughs"
tony stark,"you almost bought it, didnt you?"
narrator,"maya wears tonys glasses and smiles at him, as they start to kiss, hogan starts closing the bedroom door, suddenly they are interrupted by the plant exploding"
narrator,after the plant explodes
maya hansen,"this is what im talking about, the glitch."
tony stark,have you checked the telomerized algorithm?
maya hansen,the what?
narrator,at that moment hogan runs into the room and tackles tony onto the bed to make sure hes okay
tony stark,were good.
happy hogan,stay down.
tony stark,youre...youre right on me. i made it.
narrator,hogan gets off tony
happy hogan,what was that?
maya hansen,its a glitch in my work...
tony stark,"look, she was just talking about glitches happening."
happy hogan,its not y2k?
maya hansen,no.
narrator,tony hears people celebrating outside
tony stark,hey!
happy hogan,happy new year.
tony stark,happy new year.
maya hansen,happy new year.
tony stark,"alright, ill see you in the mornin."
narrator,tony shakes hands with hogan
happy hogan,you good?
tony stark,yep.
happy hogan,ill be right outside.
tony stark,okay.
narrator,"hogan leaves the room; we then see aldrich on top of the building waiting for tony, who never shows"
tony stark,"[voice over] so why am i telling you this? because i had just created demons, and i didnt even know it."
narrator,"we see tony writing a note you know who i am, and leaving it on the bedside table for maya before leaving; maya hears the door close"
tony stark,"[voice over]yeah, those were the good times. then i moved on. after a brief soiree in an afghan cave, i said goodbye to the party scene. forgot that night in switzerland. these days im a changed man, im different now. im well...you know who i am."
narrator,"present day, malibu, california - tony is in his lab injecting himself with some devices"
jarvis,"sir, please may i request just a few hours to calibrate..."
tony stark,no. forty-eight.[he injects himself]
tony stark,ah! micro-repeater implanting sequence complete.
jarvis,"as you wish, sir. ive also prepared a safety briefing for you to entirely ignore."
tony stark,"which i will. right, lets do this."
narrator,to the robot thats using a broom to clear the rubbish off the floor
tony stark,"dummy. hi, dummy. how did you get that cap on your head? you earned it."
narrator,tony walks towards the robot
tony stark,"hey. hey! what are you doing round in the corner? you know what you did. blood on my mat, handle it."
jarvis,"sir, may i remind you that youve been awake for nearly seventy-two hours."
narrator,addressing the iron man suits that are in their glass cages
tony stark,"focus up, ladies. good evening, and welcome to the birthing suit. im pleased to announce the imminent arrival of your bouncing, bad-ass, baby brother."
narrator,to jarvis as he records tony with a camera
tony stark,"start tight and go wide, stamp in time. mark 42 autonomous prehensile propulsion suit test. initialize sequence."
narrator,tony raises his hands and motions to activate the new suit
tony stark,"jarvis, drop my needle."
narrator,"music starts playing, tony moves with the music then points his arm where hed been injecting himself toward the dismantled iron man suit on the table opposite, nothing happens"
tony stark,crap.
narrator,"tony hits his arm where hed injected himself, he points his arm again and this time a part of the suit flies over to tony and attaches itself to his hand and extends to his arm and shoulder, tony then points his other arm toward the suit and the second part attaches itself to his hand and arm, tony laughs"
tony stark,"alright, i think we got this. send em all."
narrator,"the leg part flies over and attaches itself to tonys leg, then as another part flies over it crashes into one of the iron man suit glass cages, then another part hurls itself at tony and tony inflects it with his arm making it crash"
tony stark,"probably a little fast, slow it down. slow it down just a..."
narrator,suddenly another part of the suit shoots over and tony ducks as it narrowly misses hitting him in the head
tony stark,...little bit.
narrator,the other parts fly over and attach themselves with force to tonys back and crotch area
tony stark,"cool it, will you, jarvis?"
narrator,"then all the other parts shoot over and get attached to tony, accept for the final face piece, which just hovers, facing tony"
tony stark,come on. i aint scared of you.
narrator,the face piece flies over and tony flips over to grab the piece and finally the iron man suit is fully attached to tony
tony stark,im the best.
narrator,"at that moment, one of the stray pieces of the suit shoot over to tony, knock hims down, which knocks the entire suit, except for the head piece, off tony"
jarvis,"as always, sir, a great pleasure watching you work."
tony stark,[voice over] and i guess seventy-two hours isnt a long time between siestas. didnt think it could get any worse. then i had to go and turn on the tv.
narrator,the news on tv shows footage of the mandarin
tony stark,[voice over] thats when he happened.
the mandarin,"some people call me a terrorist, i consider myself a teacher. america, ready for another lesson. in 1864 in sand creek colorado the u.s. military waited till the friendly cheyenne braves all gone hunting, waited to attack and slaughter their families left behind, and claim their land. thirty-nine hours ago the ali al salem air base in kuwait was attacked. i...i...i did that. a quaint military church filled with wives and children, of course. the soldiers were out on maneuver, the braves were away. president ellis you continue to resist my attempts to educate you, sir. and now, youve missed me again. you know who i am, you dont know where i am, and youll never see me coming."
narrator,"as this footage ends, the tv channels change and all the news channels are talking about the mandarin"
narrator,the news on tv shows president ellis addresses the mandarin threat
president ellis,"central to my administrations response to this terrorist event, is a newly minted resource. i know him as colonel james rhodes, the american people will soon know him as the iron patriot."
narrator,we then see bill maher talking about this on his show
bill maher,and how is president ellis responding? by taking the guy they call war machine and giving him a paint job.
narrator,then we see joan rivers on the fashion police talking about the new iron man suit
joan rivers,"same suit, but painted red, white, and blue. look at that. and they also renamed him iron patriot. you know, just in case the paint was too subtle."
narrator,rhodes and tony stark are at a bar and they see joan rivers making fun of the iron patriot suit on tv
colonel james rhodes,"it tested well with focus groups, alright?"
tony stark,[putting on a mocking voice] i am iron patriot...
colonel james rhodes,"listen, war machine was a little too aggressive, alright? this sends a better message."
tony stark,"so whats really goin on? with mandarin. seriously, can we talk about this guy?"
narrator,tony moves closer to rhodes
colonel james rhodes,"its classified information, tony. okay, there have been nine bombings."
tony stark,nine.
colonel james rhodes,"the public only knows about three. heres the thing, nobody can id a device. theres no bomb casings."
tony stark,"you know i can help, just ask. i got a ton of new tech, i got a prehensile, i got a...i got a new bomb disposal. catches explosions mid-air."
colonel james rhodes,whens the last time you got a good nights sleep?
tony stark,einstein slept three hours a year. look what he did?
colonel james rhodes,"people are concerned about you, tony. im concerned about you."
tony stark,youre gonna come at me like that?
colonel james rhodes,"no. no, look, im not trying to be a dic..."
narrator,a girl and a boy come up to their table
colonel james rhodes,...tator.
erin,do you mind signing my drawing?
tony stark,"if richard doesnt mind. [to rhodes] you alright with this, dick?"
colonel james rhodes,fine with me.
narrator,tony looks at the drawing of himself in his iron man suit that the girl has drawn
erin,erin.
narrator,tony looks at the boy standing next to him
tony stark,"i loved you in a christmas story, by the way."
narrator,as tony is signing erins drawing
colonel james rhodes,"listen, the pentagon is scared. after what happened in new york... aliens, come on. they need to look strong. stopping the mandarin is priority, but its not..."
tony stark,"its superhero business, i get it."
colonel james rhodes,"no, its not, quite frankly. its american business."
tony stark,thats why i said i...got it.
narrator,"suddenly as tony is signing the drawing he looks ill, he places his hand on his face"
colonel james rhodes,are you okay?
tony stark,i broke the crayon.
erin,"are you okay, mr. stark?"
colonel james rhodes,take it easy. tony...
little boy,[the little boy whispers to tony] how did you get out of the wormhole? how did you get out of the wormhole?
narrator,suddenly tony rises and starts walking off
colonel james rhodes,wait a minute! tony!
narrator,rhodes follows tony as he walks out the bar
tony stark,whatd he say?!
colonel james rhodes,tony!
tony stark,sorry. have to check on the suit...make sure...okay.
narrator,tony steps into his iron man suit that was parked outside the bar
tony stark,"check the heart, check the...check the...is it the brain?"
jarvis,no sign of cardiac analomy or unusual brain activity
tony stark,"okay, so i was poisoned?"
jarvis,my diagnosis is that youve experienced a severe anxiety attack.
tony stark,me?
narrator,"rhodes knocks on the iron suits head, people have gathered around them watching tony"
colonel james rhodes,"come on, man. this isnt a good look, open up."
tony stark,"sorry, i gotta split."
narrator,tony flies off in his suit
narrator,at stark industries hogan points to his badge as walks through the lobby passing the other employees
happy hogan,"badge...badge...badge. badge, guys. i put a memo in the toilet, come on. [referring to tonys robots as hogan meets with pepper] tony has got them in his basement, theyre wearing party hats. this is an asset that we can put to use."
pepper potts,"uh-huh. so, youre suggesting that i replace the entire janitorial staff with robots?"
happy hogan,what im saying is that the human element of human resources is our biggest point of vulnerability. we should start phasing it out immediately.
pepper potts,what!?
happy hogan,"[to another employee as hogan walks past them] excuse me, bambi."
pepper potts,[hogan points to his badge] did you just say that?
happy hogan,security.
pepper potts,happy?
happy hogan,yes.
pepper potts,"okay, i am thrilled that youre now the head of security, okay? it is the perfect position for you."
happy hogan,thank you.
pepper potts,however...
happy hogan,i do appreciate it
pepper potts,since youve taken the post...
happy hogan,you dont have to thank me.
pepper potts,weve had a rise in staff complaints of three hundred percent
happy hogan,thank you.
pepper potts,thats not a compliment.
happy hogan,thats not a compli...? it is a compliment! clearly somebodys trying to hide something.
pepper potts,i...
peppers assistant,excuse me.
pepper potts,yes?
peppers assistant,"miss potts, your four oclock is here."
pepper potts,thank you.
happy hogan,did you clear this four oclock with me?
pepper potts,"happy, well talk about this later. but right now i have to go deal with this very annoying thing."
narrator,pepper starts walking towards her office
happy hogan,how so?
pepper potts,"i used to work with him, and he used to ask me out all the time. so its a little awkward."
narrator,hogan opens her office glass door and they enter
happy hogan,i dont like the sound of that.
narrator,"as they step inside, they see aldrich, looking handsome and fit in a business suit"
narrator,pepper looks shocked at the change in aldrichs appearance
aldrich killian,pepper.
pepper potts,killian?
aldrich killian,you look great. you look really great.
pepper potts,"god, you look...you look great. i... i...i cant... what on earth have you been doing?"
aldrich killian,"nothing fancy, just five years in the hands of physical therapists. and please, call me aldrich."
happy hogan,uh...you were supposed to be issued a security badge.
pepper potts,"happy, its okay."
happy hogan,yes?
pepper potts,were good.
happy hogan,you sure?
pepper potts,yes. stand down.
happy hogan,"okay. im gonna linger, right here."
pepper potts,thank you.
happy hogan,okay.
narrator,hogan steps out of peppers office and closes the glass door
pepper potts,"its very nice to see you, killian."
narrator,"as hogan waits outside peppers office, he sees aldrichs man sitting in the waiting area"
happy hogan,"hey, guy."
narrator,hogan points to his security badge and the guy picks up his badge from the table next to him and holds it up to show hogan he has a badge; to an employee as they walk past him
savin,merry christmas.
narrator,hogan looks at him with suspicion
narrator,back in peppers office
aldrich killian,"after years dodging the presidents ban on ""immoral biotech research"", my think tank now has a little something in the pipeline. its an idea we like to call extremis. im gonna turn your lights down."
narrator,he dims the lights then holds in his hand three small metal balls
aldrich killian,regard the human brain.
narrator,"he throws the balls onto the coffee table and as they roll and stop, they project a 3d image into the room"
aldrich killian,"uh...wait. hold on, hold on. thats...thats the universe, my bad. but if i do that..."
narrator,he presses his projector control which changes the 3d image to show inside of the brain
aldrich killian,"thats the brain. strangely mimetic though, wouldnt you say? pepper potts wow, thats amazing!"
aldrich killian,"thanks, its mine."
pepper potts,what?
aldrich killian,this...youre inside my head. its a...
narrator,"he taps behind his ear, referring to something embedded inside his head"
aldrich killian,"its a live feed. come on up, ill prove it to you."
narrator,aldrich rises from the couch and stands on the coffee table
aldrich killian,come on.
narrator,"he helps pepper to stand on the coffee table next to him, they stand directly in the 3d image"
aldrich killian,"now, pinch my arm. i can take it. pinch me."
narrator,pepper pinches him and immediately something lights up in the 3d image of aldrichs brain
pepper potts,what is that?
aldrich killian,its the primary somatosensory cortex. its the brains pain center. but this is what i wanted to show you.
narrator,he turns pepper round and presses his projector control and starts changing and moving the image with his hand
aldrich killian,"now, extremis harnesses our bioelectrical potential and it goes...here. this is essentially an empty slot, and what this tells us is that our mind, our entire dna in fact, is destined to be upgraded."
pepper potts,wow.
narrator,"as hogan sits outside peppers office, he gets a call on his tablet, he answers the call and holds the tablet high so the camera monitor shows his forehead and eyes"
happy hogan,hello?
tony stark,is this forehead of security?
happy hogan,"what? you know, look, i got a real job. what do you want? im working, i got something going on here."
narrator,we see tony is in his lab
tony stark,what? harassing interns?
happy hogan,"let me tell you something, you know what happened when i told people i was iron mans body guard? they would laugh in my face."
narrator,tony laughs
happy hogan,"i had to leave while i still had a shred of dignity. now i got a real job, im watching pepper."
tony stark,whats going on? fill me in.
happy hogan,for real?
tony stark,yeah.
happy hogan,"alright, so shes meeting up with this scientist. rich guy, handsome."
tony stark,right.
happy hogan,"i couldnt make his face at first, right? you know im good with faces."
tony stark,"oh, yeah, yeah. youre the best."
happy hogan,"yeah. well, so i run his credentials, i make him aldrich killian. we actually met the guy back in... where were we in 99? the science conference?"
tony stark,um...switzerland.
happy hogan,"right, right, exactly."
tony stark,"killian? no, i dont remember that guy."
happy hogan,"of course you dont. hes not a blond with a big rack. at first it was fine, they were talking business, but now its like getting weird. hes showing her a big brain."
tony stark,his what?
happy hogan,"big brain, and she likes it. here, let me show you. hold on. see? [he holds his tablet up and points it towards peppers glass office, where aldrich and pepper are standing close together on the coffee table watching the 3d image of the brain, but all tony sees is hogan pointing the tablet camera at himself]"
tony stark,look at what? you watching them? flip the screen and then we can get started.
happy hogan,"im not a tech genius like you. just...just trust me, get down down here."
tony stark,"flip the screen, then i can see what theyre doing."
happy hogan,i cant! i dont know how to flip the screen!dont talk to me like that anymore. youre not my boss.
narrator,"as hogan is talking, tony uses his small tablet device to look up aldrich and finds his photo"
happy hogan,"alright, i dont work for you. now i dont trust this guy. hes got another guy with him, hes shifty."
tony stark,relax.
happy hogan,seriously?
tony stark,im just asking you to secure the perimeter. tell him to go out for a drink or something?
happy hogan,"you know what? you should take more of an interest in whats going on here. this woman... this womans the best thing that ever happened to you, and you...youre just ignoring her."
tony stark,a giant brain?
happy hogan,"yeah, theres a giant brain, theres a shifty character. im gonna follow this guy. im gonna run his plates and if it gets rough, so be it."
tony stark,"i miss you, happy."
happy hogan,"yeah, i miss you too. but the way it used to be. now youre off with the superfriends, i dont know whats going on with you anymore. the worlds getting weird..."
tony stark,"hey, i...id hate to cut you off. do you have your taser on you?"
happy hogan,why?
tony stark,"i think theres a gal in hr whos trying to steal some printer ink, you should probably go over there and zap her."
narrator,he puts his small tablet in his wine fridge and closes it and walks off still with hogan online
happy hogan,"yeah, nice."
narrator,back in peppers office after aldrich has show her his new research
aldrich killian,imagine if you could hack into the hard drive of any living organism and recode its dna.
pepper potts,it would be incredible.
aldrich killian,mm.
pepper potts,"unfortunately, to my ears it also sounds highly weaponizable. as in enhanced soldiers, private armies, and tony is not..."
aldrich killian,"tony. tony. you know, i invited tony to join aim thirteen years ago, he turned me down. but something tells me now there is a new genius on the throne who doesnt have to answer to tony anymore, and who has slightly less of an ego."
pepper potts,"its gonna be a no, aldrich. as much as id like to help you."
narrator,we see aldrich leaving the building
aldrich killian,"well, i cant say that im not disappointed. but then as my father used to say, failure is the fog through which we glimpse triumph."
pepper potts,thats very deep.
aldrich killian,mm
pepper potts,and i have no idea what it means.
aldrich killian,"well, me neither. he was kind of an idiot, my old man."
narrator,pepper laughs
aldrich killian,"im sure ill see you again, pepper."
narrator,"aldrich kisses her gently on the cheek and pepper watches him as he walks off, then pepper notices hogan coming toward her, pepper looks flustered"
pepper potts,happy...
happy hogan,"the car is ready, if youre ready to go."
narrator,pepper glances over to aldrich as he walks towards his car
pepper potts,"yes. i just um...god, i forgot my other thing, so im just gonna..."
narrator,"she walks back into the building, hogan glance over to aldrichs car and as it drives away, hogan takes a photo of the license plate"
narrator,"later pepper returns to tonys home, as she gets out of the car she sees a large stuffed rabbit outside the house that tony has bought for her as a gift, she walks inside"
pepper potts,im sorry im late. i was... what the...? what is that?!
narrator,she notices tony sat in his iron man suit on the couch
pepper potts,"youre wearing this in the house now? what is that, like mark 15?"
narrator,tony looks at the small number marked 42 on the suit
tony stark,uh...yeah. something like that. you know everybody needs a hobby.
pepper potts,"oh, and you have to wear your hobby in the living room?"
narrator,tony rises and walks toward her
tony stark,"just breakin it in. you know, its always a little pinchy in the gooey bag at first, so."
narrator,tony shakes his ass and pepper laughs
tony stark,"oh hey, did you see your christmas present?"
pepper potts,"yes, i did. i...i dont know how i could have missed that christmas present. is it gonna fit through the door?"
tony stark,"well actually, uh...its a good question. i got a team of guys comin tomorrow, theyre gonna blow out that wall."
pepper potts,okay.
tony stark,"so, uh...tense? good day?"
narrator,tony walks up behind her and starts massaging her shoulders
tony stark,"ooh shoulders, a little naughty. naughty girl. i dont wanna harp on this, but did you like the custom rabbit?"
pepper potts,did i like it?
tony stark,"nailed it, right?"
pepper potts,wow. i appreciate the thought very much.
narrator,"pepper turns to face tony, she rises from her seat and stands close to him"
pepper potts,so why dont you lift up that face mask and give me a kiss?
narrator,tony knocks the metal helmet on his head
tony stark,"huh. yup, dammit. no can do. you wanna just kiss it on the..."
pepper potts,uh-huh.
tony stark,the facial slit?
pepper potts,"well, why dont i run down to the garage and see if i cant find a crowbar to shimmy that thing open?"
tony stark,crowbar. yeah.
narrator,pepper starts walking towards tonys lab
tony stark,"oh, except theres been a...uh...a radiation leak."
pepper potts,ill take my chances.
tony stark,thats risky.
narrator,pepper walks down the stairs to tonys lab
tony stark,at least let me get you like a hazmat suit or a geiger counter or something like that.
narrator,"pepper sees tony is in fact not in his iron man suit, but in the lab exercising as he remotely controls the suit, which follows pepper into the lab"
tony stark,busted.
pepper potts,this is a new level of lame.
tony stark,sorry.
narrator,pepper notices the food tray in the corner
pepper potts,"you ate without me, already? on date night?"
tony stark,[referring to mark 42 suit] he was just...
pepper potts,you mean you?
tony stark,"well, yeah. i just mean we were just...just hosting you while i finished up a little work."
pepper potts,uh-huh.
tony stark,"and yes, i had a quick bite. i didnt know if you were comin home or if you were having drinks with aldrich killian."
narrator,"mark 42 suit turns its face toward her, as if to look at her accusingly"
pepper potts,what?
tony stark,what?
pepper potts,aldrich killian? what are you checking up on me?
tony stark,happy was concerned.
pepper potts,"no, youre spying on me."
tony stark,i wasnt...
pepper potts,im going to bed.
narrator,pepper turns and starts walking off
tony stark,hold on. come on. pep.
narrator,as pepper starts walking upstairs
tony stark,"hey, i admit it! my fault. sorry."
narrator,pepper stops and looks at him
tony stark,"im a piping hot mess. its been going on for a while, i havent said anything."
narrator,pepper walks back down
tony stark,nothings been the same since new york.
pepper potts,"oh really? well, i didnt notice that, at all."
tony stark,"you experience things and then theyre over and you still cant explain em. gods, aliens, other dimensions. i...im just a man in a can. the only reason i havent cracked up is probably because you moved in. which is great. i love you, im lucky. but, honey, i cant sleep. you go to bed, i come down here. i do what i know, i tinker."
narrator,he pauses for a moment
tony stark,"but threat is imminent, and i have to protect the one thing that i cant live without. thats you. my suits, theyre uh..."
pepper potts,machines.
tony stark,but theyre part of me.
pepper potts,a distraction.
tony stark,maybe.
narrator,pepper walks towards tony and they hold each other
pepper potts,im gonna take a shower.
tony stark,okay.
narrator,"pepper turns to walk off, then stops and looks at him"
pepper potts,and youre gonna join me.
tony stark,better.
narrator,"later that night, as tony and pepper are sleeping, tony starts having nightmares about when he was in new york with the avengers and had to get rid of the nuke in space, pepper wakes and starts to shake tony awake"
pepper potts,tony! tony! tony! tony...
narrator,"suddenly pepper gets grabbed and shoved off tony by mark 42 suit, this wakes tony who commands the suit"
tony stark,power down!
narrator,"the suit shuts down and tony hits it making its pieces fall apart, he looks over at pepper who is in shock"
tony stark,"i must have called it in my sleep. thats not supposed to happen. ill recalibrate the sensors. can we just...just let me...just let me catch my breath, okay?"
narrator,pepper rises and starts to leave
tony stark,"dont go, alright? pepper?"
pepper potts,im going to sleep downstairs. tinker with that.
narrator,pepper leaves the room
narrator,"at the chinese theater in los angeles, we see aldrichs henchman meet a man whos sat outside the theater"
savin,can you regulate?
taggert,"yes, i can regulate."
savin,are you sure about that?
taggert,yes.
narrator,"hogan whos been following savin, keeps an eye on him from a distance, he sees savin giving the man a briefcase"
savin,its a decent batch. dont say i never did nothin for you.
taggert,thank you...i mean for understanding.
narrator,"savin walks off, hogan walks towards taggert and as taggert rises to leave hogan bumps into him which knock the briefcase out of taggerts hand, falling open on to the ground"
happy hogan,"im sorry, buddy."
narrator,"hogan helps him put the stuff back in the suitcase, and as he looks at taggert he notices that he is glowing red, hogan starts to walk off taking one of the items from the suitcase, but suddenly savin bumps into him"
savin,"what are you doin, buddy? you out by yourself? a little date night? watching your favorite chick flick maybe?"
happy hogan,"yeah, a little movie called ""the partys over"", starring you and your junkie girlfriend, and heres the ticket. [hogan shows him what he took from taggerts suitcase]"
savin,"no kidding? that doesnt belong to you. [savin goes to take the item from hogans hand, but hogan punches savin in the face, hogan notices savins face glow red and heal, then savin grabs hold of hogan and with super strength throws him aside, as savin walks towards hogan, taggert begins to glow red and turn super hot]"
taggert,savin!
savin,what?
taggert,"help! help me! [taggert suddenly explodes, causing a massive explosion inside the theater which wounds hogan, as he lies injured, hogan sees savin, also glowing red and then healing and walking off as if nothing has happened] [we see another tv footage from the mandarin]"
the mandarin,"true story about fortune cookies. they look chinese, they sound chinese, but theyre actually an american invention. which is why theyre hollow, full of lies, and leave a bad taste in the mouth. my disciples just destroyed another cheap american knock-off, the chinese theater. mr. president, i know this must be getting frustrating, but this season of terror is drawing to a close. and dont worry, the big one is coming; your graduation. [as hogan lies in hospital critically injured, tony is sat in his room when a nurse walks in to check on hogan]"
tony stark,hi.
happys nurse,oh.
tony stark,[referring to the tv] uh...mind leaving that on?
happys nurse,sure. [tony rises from his seat]
tony stark,"sunday nights pbs downtown abbey. thats his show, he thinks its elegant. [he pauses for a moment] one more thing...make sure everyone wears their badges. hes a stickler for that sort of thing, plus my guys wont let anyone in without them. [tony turns to leave] [news reporters are all waiting for tony outside the hospital]"
hospital news reporter,were awaiting the arrival of tony stark. were hoping hell give us the reaction...his reaction to the latest attack. [tony walks out and all the reporters swarm toward him] mr. stark! mr. stark! our sources are telling us that this is another mandarin attack. anything else you can tell us? [tony ignores the questions and walks toward his car]
pushy tabloid reporter,"hey, mr. stark! when is somebody gonna kill this guy? just sayin. [tony turns to face the reporter]"
jarvis,"ive compiled a mandarin database for you, sir. drawn from s.h.i.e.l.d., f.b.i., and c.i.a. intercepts. initiating virtual crime scene reconstruction. [tony starts looking at all the data gathered]"
tony stark,"okay, what do we got here? his name is an ancient chinese war mantle, meaning ""adviser to the king"". south american insurgency tactics, talks like a baptist preacher. theres lots of pageantry going on here...lots of theater. [tony pushes the virtual information down to close] close. [tony looks at the virtual crime scene reconstruction]"
jarvis,the heat from the blast was in excess of 3000 degrees celsius. any subjects within 12.5 yards were vaporized instantly.
tony stark,no bomb parts found in a three mile radius of the chinese theater.
jarvis,"no, sir."
tony stark,"talk to me, happy. [in the virtual reconstruction, tony sees hogan pointing his finger at some dog tags] when is a bomb not a bomb? [tony picks up the virtual image of the dog tags to investigate them further] when is a bomb not a bomb? [tony picks up the virtual image of the dog tags to investigate them further] any military victims?"
jarvis,"not according to public records, sir."
tony stark,"bring up the thermogenic signatures again, factor in three thousand degrees."
jarvis,the oracle cloud has completed analysis. accessing satellites and plotting the last twelve months of thermogenic occurrence now.
tony stark,"take away everywhere that theres been a mandarin attack. [tony looks at the information popping up] nope. [he sees an attack in rose hill, tennessee] that. you sure thats not one of his?"
jarvis,it predates any known mandarin attack. the incident was the use of a bomb to assist a suicide.
tony stark,bring it around.
jarvis,the heat signature is remarkably similar. three thousand degrees celsius. [tony looks at all the information being presented on the tennessee attack]
tony stark,"thats two military guys. ever been to tennessee, jarvis?"
jarvis,"creating a flight plan for tennessee. [as tony is about to get ready to leave for tennessee, he hears his door bell ring]"
tony stark,"are we still at ""ding-dong""? were supposed to be on total security lock down. come on, i threatened a terrorist. who is that?"
jarvis,"theres only so much i can do, sir, when you give the worlds press your home address. [we see maya standing outside tonys house, the glass doors are opened and she enters]"
tony stark,"right theres fine. [tony dressed in his iron man suit walks toward her] youre not the mandarin, are you? are you?"
maya hansen,you dont remember. why am i not surprised?
tony stark,"dont take it personally, i dont remember what i had for breakfast."
jarvis,"gluten-free waffles, sir."
tony stark,thats right.
maya hansen,"okay, look, i need to be alone with you. someplace not here, its urgent."
tony stark,"normally, id go for that sort of thing, but now im in a committed relationship. [as he turns to walk into the living room, two bags are thrown down from the above balcony] its...with her."
pepper potts,"tony, is somebody there? [tony steps out of his suit]"
tony stark,"yeah, its maya hansen. old botanist pal that i used to know, barely. [as pepper starts walking downstairs, tony moves towards maya and speaks quietly] please dont tell me that there is a twelve year-old kid waiting in the car that ive never met."
maya hansen,"hes thirteen. and no, i need your help."
tony stark,what...what for? why now?
maya hansen,"because i read the papers, and, frankly, i dont think youll last the week."
tony stark,ill be fine.
pepper potts,"im sorry. with happy in the hospital, i didnt know we were expecting guests."
tony stark,we werent.
maya hansen,"no, i..."
pepper potts,and old girlfriends!
tony stark,shes not really.
maya hansen,"no, not really. it...it was just one night."
tony stark,yep.
pepper potts,"thats how you did it, isnt it? yep."
tony stark,it was a great night.
pepper potts,"well, you know..."
maya hansen,yeah.
pepper potts,you have saved yourself a world of pain.
maya hansen,im sure.
tony stark,what?
pepper potts,trust me. [to tony] were going out of town.
tony stark,"okay, weve been through this. nope."
pepper potts,yep!
tony stark,the man says no.
pepper potts,immediately and indefinitely!
tony stark,honey...
maya hansen,great idea. lets go. ill...
tony stark,im sorry. thats a terrible idea. please dont touch her bags.
pepper potts,"tony, this is how normal people behave."
tony stark,i cant protect you out there. i challenged... [maya notices giant stuffed rabbit tony had bought for pepper]
maya hansen,is...is that normal?
tony stark,"yes, this is normal!"
pepper potts,"sadly, that...is very normal."
tony stark,"its a big bunny, relax about it!"
pepper potts,calm down!
tony stark,i got this for you.
pepper potts,im aware of that.
tony stark,you still havent even told me that you liked it!
pepper potts,i dont like it!
tony stark,"i asked you three... you dont like it?! [as tony and pepper are bickering, maya notices on the tv that helicopters are coming toward tonys home]"
pepper potts,"tony, we are leaving the house; thats not even up for discussion."
tony stark,i said no.
maya hansen,"guys, can we um..."
tony stark,what?
maya hansen,"[she points to the bomb heading straight for the house, the house is suddenly hit, as everything explodes around them, tony manages to get his iron man suit onto pepper to protect her from the fall, tony looks over to maya, whos lying unconscious on the ground, as the ceiling is about to fall on tony, pepper saves him with the iron man suit] do we need to worry about that?"
pepper potts,i got you.
tony stark,"i got you first. like i said, we cant stay here. [the helicopters starts shooting at the house] move! im right behind! [as they run to get out, the floor in front of tony collapses, pepper manages to get on the other side] get her, im gonna find a way around. [pepper hesitates] stop stopping! get her, get outside! go! [pepper manages to grab maya and use the iron man suit to get them safely out of the house, but the house gets further destroyed as the helicopters continue to fire on it]"
pepper potts,oh my god. tony! [back inside as the house is being destroyed around tony]
jarvis,"sir, miss potts is clear of the structure. [tony motions for his iron man suit to come off pepper and onto him]"
tony stark,"jarvis, wheres my flight power?!"
jarvis,"working on it, sir. this is a prototype. [tony manages to use his suit to destroy one of the helicopters]"
tony stark,thats one.
jarvis,"sir, the suit is not combat-ready. [tony manages to get away from the bullets being fired at him from one of the remaining helicopters and again uses his suit to bring down the helicopter]"
tony stark,"thats two. [as the helicopter explodes it crashes into the house, the remaining helicopter continues on shooting at the house, finally the remains of house with tony inside fall into the ocean, pepper runs to the edge of the cliff and looks down into the ocean] tony! [in the water, tony starts to feel like hes drowning]"
jarvis,"sir, take a deep breath. [after a few moments tonys suit gets its flight power activated by jarvis] flight power restored. [finally tony manages to fly out of the ocean [inside the suit jarvis tries to wake tony] sir. sir!"
tony stark,"alright, kill the alarm. i got it."
jarvis,"thats the emergency alert triggered by the power dropping below five percent. [tony notices that hes flying through the snow at night, he falls and crashes into the ground in the middle of a forest, he takes off his face helmet as he lies on the ground catching his breath]"
tony stark,"its snowing, right? where are we, upstate?"
jarvis,"were five miles outside of rose hills, tennessee."
tony stark,"why?! jarvis! not my idea! what are we doing here? this is thousands of miles away, i gotta get pepper, i gotta..."
jarvis,i prepared a flight plan. this was the location.
tony stark,who asked you? open the suit.
jarvis,"i...i think i may be malfunctioning, sir."
tony stark,open eject. [the suit gets off tony and he sits up] thats brisk! [as tony starts to feel the cold weather] maybe ill just cozy back up for a bit.
jarvis,"i actually think i need to sleep now, sir. [the suit loses power]"
tony stark,"jarvis. jarvis? dont leave me, buddy. [tony drags the suit to a petrol station and makes a call to pepper]"
tony stark,"pepper, its me. ive got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time. so first off, im so sorry i put you in harms way. that was selfish and stupid and it wont happen again. also, its christmas time, the rabbits too big. done. sorry. and im sorry in advance because...i cant come home yet. i need to find this guy. you gotta stay safe. thats all i know. i just stole a poncho from a wooden indian. [tony drags the suit to an abandoned looking farmhouse, he places the suit on a couch and sits next to it] lets get you comfy. [he places its hand by its side] you happy now? [as tony tries to fix the micro-repeater implants in his arm a boy stands by the doorway and points his toy gun at tony]"
harley keener,freeze! dont move.
tony stark,"you got me. nice potato gun. barrels a little long. between that and the wide gauge, its gonna diminish your fps. [the boy points his gun at a glass on a shelf and shoots at it, breaking the glass] and now youre out of ammo."
harley keener,whats that thing on your chest?
tony stark,"its a electromagnet. you should know, youve got a box of them right here."
harley keener,what does it power? [tony stands and points the desk light at his suit sitting on the couch behind him] oh my god! [harley drops his toy gun and takes a step towards tony] that...thats... is that iron man?
tony stark,"technically, i am."
tony stark,a valid point.
harley keener,[referring to the suit as he sits next to it on the couch checking it out] what happened to him?
harley keener,like a mechanic?
tony stark,yeah.
harley keener,oh. if i was building iron man and war machine...
tony stark,its iron patriot now.
harley keener,thats way cooler!
tony stark,"no, its not."
harley keener,"anyways, i would have added in um... the retro..."
tony stark,retroreflective panels?
harley keener,to make him stealth mode.
tony stark,you want a stealth mode?
harley keener,"cool, right?"
tony stark,thats actually a good idea. maybe ill build one.
harley keener,"[as he touches the suit, harley accidentally snaps off one of its fingers] oops!"
tony stark,"not a good idea! what are you doing? youre gonna break his finger? hes in pain, hes been injured. leave him alone."
harley keener,sorry.
tony stark,"are you? dont worry about it, ill fix it. so, uh, whos home?"
harley keener,"well, my mom already left for the diner and dad went to 7-eleven to get scratchers. i guess he won, cause that was six years ago."
harley keener,whats in it for me?
tony stark,salvation. whats his name?
harley keener,who?
tony stark,"the kid that bullies you at school, whats his name?"
harley keener,howd you know that?
tony stark,"i got just the thing. [he opens a compartment on the suit and takes out a metal object] this is a pinata for a cricket. im kidding, its a very powerful weapon. point it away from your face, press the button on top. it discourages bullying. non-lethal, just to cover ones ass. [harley reaches out to take it, but tony pulls his hand away] deal? deal? whatd you say?"
harley keener,deal.
tony stark,deal? [tony gives the object to harley] whats youre name?
harley keener,harley. and youre...
tony stark,"the mechanic. tony [tony looks at harley for a moment] you know what keeps going through my head? wheres my sandwich? back at tonys house, which is now surrounded by emergency rescue and news reporters, pepper stands alone and looks at one of tonys shattered iron man helmets, she notices a red flashing light inside the helmet and as she puts the helmet on she receives the message tony had left her earlier] pepper, its me. ive got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time. so first off, im so sorry i put you in harms way. that was selfish and stupid and it wont happen again. [later that night as pepper drives maya home]"
pepper potts,why were you at the house tonight? what was so important that you had to speak to tony?
maya hansen,"i think that my boss is working for the mandarin. so if you still want to talk about it, i suggest that we get ourselves someplace safe."
pepper potts,"your boss works for the mandarin, you think? but tony says youre a botanist, so..."
maya hansen,"that figures. what i actually am is a biological dna coder running a team of forty out of a privately-funded think tank, but sure you can call me a botanist."
pepper potts,"this boss of yours, does he have a name?"
maya hansen,"yeah, aldrich killian. [pepper looks at her in shock] [we see aldrich talking on the phone to savin]"
savin,"well, we took the house down, sir..."
aldrich killian,mmhmm.
savin,but theres no sign of a body.
aldrich killian,i see.
savin,no stark.
aldrich killian,"i have to go. [aldrich rises from his seat walks towards another room] the master is about to record and hes a little... well, you know how he gets. keep your appointment tonight and call me when its done. [aldrich walks into a room which has been set up as a set with all of mandarins props in place and camera crew ready to record mandarins message] alright everybody. no talking and no eye contact, unless you wanna get shot in the face. [we then see the mandarin arrive with his entourage and enter the house]"
mandarin look-out,"the master is traveling. [the mandarin arrives on set and takes a sit, he looks at aldrich]"
the mandarin,"well then, what are we waiting for? [in rose hills, tennessee, tony and harley walk in town at night]"
tony stark,"the sandwich was fair, the spring was a little rusty, the rest of the materials, ill make do. by the way, when you said your sister had a watch, i was kinda hoping for something a little more than that. [he pulls his sleeve up and we see hes wearing a little girls pink watch, harley laughs]"
harley keener,"shes six! anyway, its limited edition. when can we talk about new york?"
tony stark,"maybe never, relax about it."
harley keener,"what about the avengers, can you talk about them?"
tony stark,"i dont know, later. hey kid, give me a little space. [they stop and tony looks at the remains of the local explosion site that tony came to investigate] whats the official story here? what happened?"
harley keener,"i guess this guy named chad davis, used to live roundabouts, won a bunch of medals in the army. one day, folks said he went crazy and made, you know, a bomb. then he blew himself up right here. [tony looks around at the remains]"
tony stark,"six people died, right?"
harley keener,yeah.
tony stark,including chad davis?
harley keener,yeah. [tony keeps looking around at the remains of the explosion site]
tony stark,"yeah. that doesnt make sense. [he sits next to harley] think about it. six dead, only five shadows."
harley keener,"yeah, people said these shadows are like the mark of souls gone to heaven. except the bomb guy, he went to hell on account of he didnt get a shadow. thats why theres only five."
tony stark,do you buy that?
harley keener,thats what everyone says. you know what this crater reminds me of?
tony stark,no idea. im not...i dont care.
harley keener,"that giant wormhole, in um...in new york. does it remind you?"
tony stark,thats manipulative. i dont want to talk about it.
harley keener,are they coming back? the aliens?
tony stark,"maybe. can you stop? remember when i told you, that i have an anxiety issue?"
harley keener,does this subject make you...make you edgy?
tony stark,"yeah, a little bit. can i just catch my breath for a second?"
harley keener,are there bad guys in rose hills? do you...do you need a plastic bag to breathe into? do you have medication?
tony stark,nope.
harley keener,do you need to be on it?
tony stark,probably.
harley keener,do you have ptsd?
tony stark,i dont think so.
harley keener,"are you...are you going completely mental? i can stop, do you want me to stop? do you want me to stop?"
tony stark,"remember when i said to stop doing that? i swear to god, youre going to freak me out! [tony, looking agitated, suddenly rises] ah man, you did it, didnt you? you happy now?"
harley keener,"what did i say? [tony starts running off and harley runs after him] hey, wait up! wait, wait. [tony stops running and harley catches up with him] what the hell was that? [tony holds his face in his hands for a moment and then throws some snow at harley]"
tony stark,"your fault, you spazzed me out. okay, back to business. where were we? the guy who died...relatives? mom? mrs. davis, where is she?"
harley keener,where she always is.
tony stark,"see, now youre being helpful. [later we see tony walking towards a bar and he bumps into a woman] sorry. [the woman drops something] lady, this uh... [he picks up the item and hands it back to the woman]"
brandt,thank you. [tony notices the woman has burn marks on one side of her face]
tony stark,"nice haircut, suits you."
brandt,nice watch.
tony stark,"yeah, limited edition."
brandt,"oh, i dont doubt it. [theres a moments pause] well, have a good evening. [the woman turns and walks off] [tony enters the bar and walks up to mrs. davis, whos sat at table drinking alone]"
tony stark,"mrs. davis, mind if i join you?"
mrs. davis,free country.
tony stark,"it sure is. [tony sits next to her, mrs. davis looks at tony for a moment]"
mrs. davis,alright. whered you like to start?
tony stark,i just want to say im sorry about your loss. i want to know what you think happened.
mrs. davis,"look, i brought your damn file. you take it and go. [she drops the file in front of him] whatever was in here, he wanted no part of it. [tony opens the file]"
tony stark,"clearly, youre waiting for someone else. yeah? supposed to meet somebody here?"
mrs. davis,yeah. [tony looks at the file again and notices a photo of taggart next to the photo of chad]
tony stark,"mrs. davis, your son didnt kill himself, i guarantee you. he didnt kill anyone. someone used him."
mrs. davis,what?
tony stark,as a weapon.
mrs. davis,"youre not the person who called me after all, are you? [suddenly a cell phone is slammed on their table]"
brandt,"actually, i am. [tony looks up and its the woman he bumped into outsid the bar] [suddenly brandt grabs hold of tonys arm and twists it, slamming his head onto the table, tony manages to quickly grab hold of chads dog tags that were on the table]"
rose hills sheriff,"hey, hey, hey! whats all this about? what the hells going on here?"
brandt,"its called an arrest. [she pushes tony to the ground and steps towards the sheriff] sheriff, is it?"
rose hills sheriff,"yes maam, it is. and you are?"
brandt,homeland security. [she holds up her badge] we good here?
rose hills sheriff,"no, were not good. i need a little more information than that."
brandt,"well, i think its a little above your pay grade, sheriff."
rose hills sheriff,"yeah, well, why dont you get on the horn to nashville and uh...upgrade me? [tony gestures to mrs. davis to hide the file, she pushes it under the bar]"
brandt,"alright, you know what? i was hoping to do this the smart way, but uh...the fun ways always good. [tony notices her hand turning red hot, burning the badge in her hand]"
rose hills sheriff,"deputy, get this woman and... [suddenly brandt shoves the hot badge into the sheriffs face, she takes his gun and shoots him, tony runs out of the bar and brandt follows him, he turns to her]"
tony stark,"hey hot wings, you wanna party? you and me, lets go. [as tony turns to run again he sees savin getting out of a car and walk towards him, as savin gets his gun out to shoot at him, tony runs off and harley throws something at savin to make him miss tony, tony stops behind a car and sees a man hiding low on the ground] crazy, huh?"
rose hill christmas tree shopper,yeah.
tony stark,"watch this. [tony smashes into the window of a shop] [as tony and brandt are fighting in the shop, tony starts a fire in shop] you walked right into this one, ive dated hotter chicks than you. [tony puts chads dog tags into the microwave and he turns on the gas]"
brandt,thats all you got? cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner?
tony stark,"sweetheart, that could be the name of my autobiography. [tony quickly leaves through the back door, as the dog tags heat up in the microwave they start sparking up fire, brandt realizes the gas has been left on and suddenly the shop explodes killing brandt] [tony finds the savin has grabbed harley]"
harley keener,let me go! [savin mocks harley]
savin,"help me! help me! [as tonys leg is trapped under some rubble, savin sits in front of him with harley sat on his lap] hey kid, what would you like for christmas?"
harley keener,"mr. stark, i am so sorry!"
