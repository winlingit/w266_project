narrator,"fade in: int. professor ock""s private physics laboratory, the cyclotron room (credit sequence) - day a mighty warning klaxon assaults our ears. a flashing red warning light stabs our eyes. several dials go into the red. a hand pushes aside a yellow thermos and pushes forward a red power throttle. we hear the whining up of a cyclotron. a digital dial climbs to ""5% power."" a spider crawls across a dial. begin opening credits. the cyclotron room is in an old basement full of peeling paint and plumbing wrapped with tape. leaks are here and there. cobwebs are all around. doctor otto octavius (ock) is a strong but strange featured man in his mid-fifties. his assistant, weiner, hovers nearby looking on. hes open mouthed with a mindless kind of curiosity. weiner is a local, small-time hood hired by ock to circumvent the school administration and to ""procure"" whatever ock needs for his experiments. he shades his eyes against a searing blue-white beam that erupts from the window. the room is divided into a control room and the experiment chambers."
weiner,"whoa, whoa, whoa... whats that?"
narrator,"with a whoosh, the window explodes, showering the two with shards of glass, and throwing them to the floor."
ock,(rising) we begin again... lets kick in that new transducer. see if we can double the power output.
weiner,"(rising more slowly) whoa, doc... wait a minute..."
narrator,"but ock is already at the throttle. the cyclotron whirls up. the lights go on. louder, brighter than before. ock looks through the broken window into the experimental chamber. the power dial inches upward, ""eight, nine..."" the blue-white light is blinding now. the whine pitch is shattering. end opening credits."
ock,okey... dokey!
narrator,"the power dial hits ten. ext. empire state university - day as students go to class, the sound of the cyclotron spills out of the science center onto the grounds of empire state university. we see peter parker, a pleasant faced senior whos among the top in his class. sincere and serious, he has yet to develop a way with women."
liz,(falling in step) hiya peter...
narrator,liz allen is also a senior. shes beautiful and intelligent.
peter,(ardent but uncomfortable) hiya liz... howre you doing...?
liz,(teasing softly) howm i doing what?
harry,peter! peter! wait up!
narrator,"harry is the school nerd. a quirky kid who, like peter, can be a little backward around girls, especially pretty ones like liz."
harry,"(to liz) would you, uh... excuse us for a minute?"
narrator,"despite peters protesting body language, harry pulls him away like a conspirator."
peter,what is it? what...
harry,did the astro-physics journal really accept your paper?
peter,"(laughs, embarrassed) yeah... well... all i gots the data but theyve agreed to publish it when its finished. you know... its my calculation on the planetary conjunction."
harry,and its influence on the anti-force. isnt it?
peter,"yes. look, harry, i am busy with... (indicates liz standing there)"
harry,"yeah, you and the rest of the class. every one is busy with liz."
liz,(growing impatient) peter?
narrator,a hand reaches in and smacks her bottom.
flash,"hiya, cupcakes..."
liz,(elbowing him affectionately) flash...!
narrator,they kiss and walk away.
harry,(sneering) and flash is the busiest of them all...
peter,"(disappointed) come on, harry... well be late for octavius."
narrator,harry makes a gesture dismissing ock as crazy.
harry,"ock is nuts, dont you agree?"
peter,"ock is a genius, harry. crazy, yes! but, a genius misunderstood, and unappreciated."
narrator,"int. cyclotron area hallway - day it is a basement hallway full of lockers which students are banging open and shut as they put stuff in and take stuff out. in their midst, a man is banging on the door marked ""cyclotron room - authorized personnel only!"" professor rosomorf, sixtish, respectable, a good old fashioned professor, hes the head of the physics dept. with him is alexander thorkel, a 40-ish, waspish school administrator. for a scientist as crazily focused as ock, thorkel is a natural enemy."
roz,(knocking furiously) doctor octavius! you are late for your lecture. the students are waiting. doctor octavius!
thorkel,"your friend is impossible professor rosomorf, i told the board we should let him go."
narrator,the light above thorkels head explodes. then all the lights behind him explode in succession. thorkel and roz look amazed...
thorkel,"whats he doing in there, not his crazy experiment again."
roz,you mean his anti-force theory... one day theyll give him the nobel prize for it.
thorkel,meanwhile he is demolishing our university. octavius!! (knocks) open the door.
narrator,int. ocks lab
ock,"the anti-force experiment has now reached the limit of electronic overload safety. therefore, weiner, you will disconnect the overload safety device..."
narrator,"four waldos (three-fingered, snake-like mechanical arms) suddenly thrust themselves into the chamber and begin working, each at a different task. ock is an acknowledged master at manipulating these waldos. he flicks a switch and a searing blue-white beam lances down from a focusing cone and strikes a gram weight marked, ""1,000,000""), illuminating it and filling our ears with a splitting buzz tone. the knock on the door grows louder. weiner comes up behind ock."
weiner,"whoa, doc... someones at the door..."
ock,(ignoring) world class scientific mind and they stick me in the basement with this third rate cyclotron...
narrator,"insert: the dial marked ""relative gravity"" reads ""1,000,000"" but suddenly it snaps to ""0.999999!"""
ock,okey! dokey!
narrator,"the weight begins to jiggle and, for an instant, it appears to lift ever so slightly. int. college physics lab - day this is an enormous room, 100 lab tables. the yellowing smoke of a thousand experiments hangs in the air. a huge american flag dominates the back wall. peter, harry and liz set up their tables. flash reads the daily bugle sports section. peter cant take his eyes off liz. when she looks back he looks down at his gear."
liz,"(softly) what is it, peter?"
peter,(embarrassed) its nothing.
narrator,int. ocks lab weiner opens the door and sees roz and thorkel waiting impatient.
weiner,"yes, gentleman can i help you?"
thorkel,"tell your boss, that his class is waiting."
weiner,(looks) you better tell him yourself.
narrator,"thorkel looks at roz who waves his shoulder, then the both call."
roz & thorkel,professor octavius!!
narrator,professor ock turns and looks at the bewildered men.
ock,"gentlemen, come, you must see this."
roz,"but, your students..."
ock,the imbeciles can wait... i have better things to do than teach introductory physics rosomorf. undergrads are kindless adolescence.
thorkel,you see he is impossible.
ock,thorkel you are the dummiest administrator our university has ever had. (thorkel turns to go) dont go thorkel!! come! look!
narrator,he starts to play his machines handles and buttons.
thorkel,the university pays you to teach something to your students.
narrator,int. college physics lab - day
liz,"well, do you mean nothing... or do you mean something but you wont tell me what it is?"
peter,(regaining) i mean plain nothing.
liz,"well, i guess thats about as nothing as you can get... plain nothing. a beat."
peter,liz...!
liz,"ahh, it is something."
peter,no... look.
narrator,"the equipment on her table is starting to vibrate. they look at it, curiously. we hear the cyclotrons whine begin to build... int. cyclotron room - day everything is shaking like in an earthquake... roz and thorkel seem to dance in their place going crazy with anger and surprise. the whine is deafening! the light is blinding! weiner has his eyes closed and his hands over his ears."
ock,i am going for 20 percent power!
thorkel,no!! dont do that...
roz,ock! its dangerous...
thorkel,ock i warn you...
narrator,"weiner crosses himself. the console erupts in sparks. int. electrical conduit montage - day we follow the electrical overcharge as it crackles along the wires and cables inside the walls and floors. it is making its way up to the lab! int. lab - day all the kids are now trying to hold onto their vibrating equipment. the charge crackles up a wire and erupts at lizs table. a breaker explodes in flames. there is an outburst of ad libs: ""fire!"" ""everybody out!"" thorkel (comes running he is shabby and bewildered) seeing liz trapped behind the fire which is growing from second to second."
thorkel,"keep calm, everybody keep calm. use the front door. everybody out the front."
peter,liz! come on...!
liz,i cant. help me!
peter,im coming!
narrator,"he wades into the fire, but is beaten back by the flames. his sleeve is on fire. he pats it out."
liz,peter!
narrator,flash appears and tries to help but thorkel stops him.
thorkel,"get back, you idiots. you cant go in there!"
narrator,"liz smashes at the window, but this is an inner city school and the windows are covered by steel gates. liz wraps her fingers in the gate."
liz,(out at the street) help! help me!
narrator,"outside the window the air is clear and people come and go. some are stopping to look up at the girl on the second floor who screams (but they cant hear, of course) down at them as the flames close in behind her. peter comes flying in with a fire extinguisher. he fumbles with it. flash pushes thorkel, grabs the extinguisher away from him with a scowl of disdain. liz turns to face the flames. suddenly there is an eruption of co2 clouds and the roar of a fire extinguisher. the flames are beaten down enough for her to leap out. flash is there, holding the extinguisher. people cheer."
peter,thanks for your help flash.
flash,no problem wimp.
peter,our hero has a real way with words.
liz,"oh, why dont you grow up."
narrator,"peter is stung, insulted, turns away. rosomorf peeps in, worried -- faces thorkel."
thorkel,this man will bring a disaster upon this university.
narrator,"ock comes in, starts his lecture calmly as if nothing has happened."
ock,the universe is made up of forces... and counter-forces. science is the study of the forces!
narrator,"flash hands the extinguisher to peter. liz embraces flash, throwing a glimpse at peter who tried so bravely. he looks away and turns the last of the extinguisher on the last of the fire."
ock,"(continues without a hitch) but i... professor otto octavius... have devoted my life to the study of the counter-forces! good job, peter."
peter,"(taking place at lab table) thanks, professor."
narrator,thorkel has walked slowly and uncomprehendingly toward the front of the huge lab. he simply cannot believe ocks behavior.
thorkel,"i dont believe it, i simply dont..."
ock,can we carry on mr. thorkel.
thorkel,"i dont believe... oh, all right carry on professor."
ock,well! this week my dear students i have made a stunning breakthrough...
thorkel,"wait a minute, wait a minute... youve got fire forms to fill out, dr. octavius."
ock,"i have no time for forms, or administrators who persist in interrupting me, mr. thorkel."
narrator,thorkel steams out and bangs shut the door.
ock,i now believe its possible that these counter forces can be... collected... the way the magnifying glass collects the sunlight... and focused into a hard beam i call... weiner!
narrator,"weiner backs away from the blackboard to reveal a word that ock has scrawled in large letters. it says ""anti- force."""
ock,"i call it, the anti-force!"
narrator,ock is plugging a huge cable into a small lucite box with a silver ball inside it.
ock,"(continues as he works) this anti-force, once harnessed, is capable of undoing any natural force at which it is aimed... for instance... (looks up maniacally) gravity!"
narrator,"liz scribbles down a note and mouths the word ""gravity."" then she turns to peter."
liz,(whispers) im sorry...
peter,its alright.
narrator,"ock is ""playing"" his computer like the phantom of the opera at the organ."
ock,we patch in the cyclotron... the lights flicker and go dim.
ock,"pay no attention to the lights... i of course steal its energy, and it looses power. we patch in the cyclotron... and we gradually apply power. the power that i am stealing..."
narrator,"as the whine builds in the lab... ock peers through the lucite box at us, distorted by it. the box is a miniature version of the cyclotrons experimental chamber, and now the blue-white glow begins. it crackles round the silver ball."
ock,"and so we stand, four square against the fundamental force that orders and maintains our universe... gravity... which is holding down this goddamn ball. rise!"
narrator,the lights go totally dark. the kids react with whoops and catcalls.
harry,what a crock...
peter,shut up harry... this is very interesting.
ock,mr. parker! have you some... interesting observation youd like to share with the class?
peter,no sir...
ock,then shut up! and pay some attention to the experiment.
narrator,ock peers at us through the lucite box as the silver ball begins to rise. ocks face is ecstatic.
ock,rise! rise!!!
narrator,"the silver ball suddenly shoots up, shattering the top of the box. it flies up to the ceiling where it shatters a light fixture. the shards rain down on ock who reaches out and catches the falling ball and scales it in a raised fist."
ock,now thats what i call an experiment!
narrator,"the cyclotron whine cuts out and ock wheels to the computer. he hits a key and several colored projection beams lance out of the back of the room. they pierce the smoke and light a projection display in the front. two colored spheres one, yellow, one blue touch where their circumferences meet. behind them is a black depiction of ""space""."
ock,you are looking at a representation of two universes. our blue one. our real universe... something we can touch and feel and see and draw calculations about. this is us. the yellow universe... this is something else. some other dimension... something... on the other side!
narrator,ock hits another computer key and a hole appears where the two spheres touch. the blue and the yellow marbleize with each other. the colors swirl until both spheres are
ock,"if it were possible to generate enough power behind it, the anti-force could wipe out not just gravity... but all our universal forces at the same time. in effect... it would blast a hole between this universe and the next. each... (indicates green spheres) would flow into each other. no blue universe. no yellow. end, finished, over."
liz,(with a students ear) that sounds like a scenario for the end of the world.
ock,"my girl, it is! it is. it would mean wiping out everything thats known... and letting in everything thats unknown."
flash,isnt that a little dangerous?
ock,"dont worry yourself, true inter- dimensional penetration is still purely theoretical, but one day... maybe very near... maybe in the 21st century..."
narrator,"int. basement hallway - day peter, liz, flash and harry all take books from their lockers."
liz,"(whispers to peter) look, its just... i dont know... when you and flash go after each other like that..."
peter,(whispers) hes not my type.
liz,he doesnt have to be.
peter,check.
liz,"and besides, hes not all bad."
narrator,peter looks at flash whos a few lockers down. flash has taken a football from his locker and is spinning it on his finger with great joy and concentration.
peter,"you dont get nicknamed flash because youre a rocket scientist, liz."
liz,"give it up, parker. youd die for a nickname like flash."
peter,"yeah, of embarrassment."
narrator,kim comes by and leans seductively by her locker. kim is a ripe one and hot-hot-hot!
kim,"(teasing) hey, flash... im scalping a pair of the midnight madness wrestling match tomorrow night."
flash,the slammies??? id kill for that!!!
kim,would you pay $125?
flash,"well, uh, i... gee... if... can i tell you tomorrow?"
kim,"(moving on) you snooze, you lose. hiya liz..."
liz,"kim, you know peter and harry? this is my new roommate... kim nickson."
narrator,"kim is pulling her pet, a foot long salamander, out of her locker. she wraps it around her neck and turns to the boys. they go bug-eyed!"
kim,"(interested) hellooo, peter."
peter,(embarrassed) hi...
liz,were going to the student reunion meeting. you coming?
narrator,"peter looks at kim. wow. then he looks at liz whos adjusting herself in a small mirror. harry jabs him in the ribs. yeah, yeah!"
peter,(frustrated) i cant... i gotta go over to the daily bugle. im trying to sell some photos.
kim,"soooh, a photographer...?"
peter,"just an amateur. well... nice meeting you, kim."
kim,yeah... i bet it would be.
harry,can i be your date for the reunion shooshoo?
kim,no jerk!
harry,(she turns to go) what did i say...
liz,"its not what you said, its how you say it, shooshoo!"
narrator,"everybody leaves and harry is left alone, he throws his bag down."
harry,damn!
narrator,peter turns to go and comes face to face with the hulking weiner.
weiner,"peter, doc ock wants to see you."
peter,about my data i bet.
weiner,i dont know.
peter,"he knows about my work on the planetary conjunction, doesnt he?"
weiner,(lies) i dont know.
narrator,int. control room - day peter enters wide-eyed behind weiner. this place is a far cry from the experiment in the lab room. its a fantastic netherworld to which no undergrad gains entrance. no one but peter. ock is sitting in a swivel chair with his back to peter. he has the look of captain nemo in his nautilus. this is ocks domain.
peter,"hello, professor octavius. (no response) i really admired your experiment."
ock,"(back to peter) we have a lot of interests in common, peter. perhaps we should put our heads together, if you know what i mean..."
peter,(flattered) that would be... great.
ock,"(turns with a smile) now you take the planetary conjunction. this saturday night we will witness saturn, jupiter, the moon, the earth, the sun... all in a row. never seen within the memory of man, or measured for its effect. the total gravitational force must be quite exceptional. isnt that the subject of your paper...?"
peter,"yes sir, ive worked out a new way to calculate the combined gravitational effect."
ock,"im a busy man, mr. parker. but i think i could find the time to go over it with you. make sure it all... checks out."
peter,"well... im sort of working with professor rosomorf and he suggested we kind of keep it between us. he thinks that my theory is... well, i dont know..."
ock,"(to himself) the scoundrel... (turns angry) i want to see that data, peter!"
peter,"but professor octavius... if i knew you were interested... sorry, ive already given it to... professor rosomorf, and he is after all the head of our physics department... and i couldnt..."
narrator,ock turns sweet again. he smiles too broadly.
ock,"well, im certain something can be worked out. run along, young man."
narrator,peter begins to leave.
ock,just a minute... how about if i show you my discoveries... something i never showed to any other student... as a matter of fact to anybody at all.
peter,"well i am really flattered, i mean id love to... but i..."
ock,very well shall we say if you come here tonight...
peter,but professor i dont now if i should...
ock,make it eight sharp... ill be waiting for you... right here...
narrator,peter looks worried then leaves. ock turns to weiner who slouches against the wall smiling.
ock,"the same academic world thats so keen to embrace that boys undergraduate work, ridicules my anti-force theory as quackery. i ask you, weiner... what is our society coming to? ha!"
weiner,"they are all a bunch of brainless assholes, thats what i say..."
ock,weiner! go get me that boys data!
weiner,cost you fifty bucks.
ock,"(weiner hissing) just get it. well negotiate your fee when you have the data, alright weiner?"
narrator,"ext. daily bugle - day establish as art deco building well beyond its prime. a sign says: ""the daily bugle."" peter enters the building."
jameson,"garbage! absolute, 100% garbage!"
narrator,"int. jamesons office - day very forties, very messy. j. jameson scans some photos as peter stands helplessly by."
jameson,bag ladies. i hate bag ladies.
peter,"yes, sir."
narrator,"jameson is 50ish, grey at the temples, brush cut on top. he too is forties. his chewed up cigar is forties. this guy is a hard case."
jameson,"(looks at the other photos) little kids... i hate little kids. this is a daily newspaper. we need news value photographs, not artsy-fartsy shit!"
peter,"yes, sir."
narrator,jameson comes to a picture of a business suited man with a mohawk. peter smiles in anticipation.
jameson,kid? you want a pros assessment?
peter,"yes, sir!"
jameson,"(handing photos back) your photos suck. (cigar for emphasis) parker, my readers are morons. i gotta grab them by the eyes. every time you press the button of that nikon of yours it costs you fifty-five cents. so the next time youre about to take the plunge, ask yourself, am i taking dog bites man? because if you are..."
peter,"i know, i know. you want man bites dog..."
jameson,"parker, this is the post modern 20th century. i want man eats dog! get out!"
narrator,"ext. street - day a seedy east village walk up. peter takes his camera and takes various shots of a wino. all in. he climbs the stairs to his building, looks through the mail, he collects from a beaten down mailbox."
peter,"(reading) rent! rent, more bills, rent... electricity, bills..."
narrator,"int. peters apartment - day a one-room, shabby roof apartment, a chaos of books and papers. a photo enlarger and darkroom baths in kitchen pots; 8x10s tacked to the walls; a spare camera and lenses. self-consciously wacky kitsch; plastic dinosaurs, wind-up toys, a stuffed carp. an unmade bed and a 50s dinette set are the only furniture. a grimy skylight leads to the roof. its not a pretty place, but it has personality. a voice from the kitchen, a shadow of an intruder, is sneaking around."
peter,theres nothing in there worth stealing!
may,(from within the kitchen) thats the understatement of the year.
peter,"aunt may, youre trespassing."
may,(comes in) i was just so desperately bored... i thought id come over and make you dinner...
peter,i am old enough to... to make my own--
may,but i didnt feel like getting to know your roaches.
peter,ill introduce you.
may,oh. and those foul chemicals in the pots...
peter,"i take pictures, remember?"
may,"anyway, ive decided to kidnap you for dinner in forest hills..."
narrator,"she grabs her coat, crosses back to peter and tugs on his shoulder."
peter,its friday night...
may,yes. do you have a date?
peter,no.
may,then come on.
narrator,"int. large computer lab - night it is dark and empty except for computers. sitting at it, lit by the glow of its screen, is solomon rosomorf (roz). as he works, a door opens behind him. someone walks quietly through the lab. rosomorf keeps working. the intruder approaches..."
thorkel,"(at his ear) professor rosomorf, what happened here?"
roz,someone tried to rob me of some paper... i suspect they were looking for that one.
thorkel,what is it?
roz,(unruffled) award winning stuff. (turning slightly) peter parkers data on the planetary conjunction. damn lucky i hid it in my computer under another title.
thorkel,"my god, whats going on in our school? first professor octavius almost blows up the physics lab... now this. you report it in triplicate, of course."
roz,"thorkel, be careful when you talk to octavius. remember... the man is a very fragile genius. one day hell bring us all the noble prize."
thorkel,"rosomorf, the man is a very dangerous crackpot!"
narrator,off screen the voice of the cyclotron whine begins to build.
roz,thats him again. hes working day and night.
thorkel,"i tell you the man is very dangerous. (the whine grows louder) come on rosomorf, lets stop him before this building will explode."
narrator,"int. cyclotron room - night ock and weiner are at work as before. ock takes no notice of the two men who come in, nor the worker who comes in behind them and sets to work attaching a big lock to the door."
thorkel,"shut it down, octavius."
narrator,ock ignores him. weiner touches ocks shoulder. ock ignores him too.
thorkel,youve blown half the circuits in the science center.
ock,call an electrician.
thorkel,i have called the locksmith.
ock,what... what is he doing.
narrator,he points toward the worker whos working on the lock on the main door.
thorkel,we have to shut your lab down and take a look at the lines.
roz,"please, otto, we must lock it up."
ock,(to thorkel) youre denying me access to my cyclotron?!
thorkel,you bet.
narrator,"ock glares back and forth between the two men, the worker, and weiner. then he pulls back the red power throttle. the whine descends. the waldos pull back and dangle from their panel. the whine dies."
ock,"(contemplating) okey, dokey... just give me till tomorrow. i want to clean up my papers. tomorrow... ha... tomorrow you can have this room..."
roz,oh... well thorkel... few more hours wont make a difference.
thorkel,i hope.
narrator,"he signals to the worker to stop. int. apartment of aunt may and uncle ben - night the n.y. mets are playing baseball on t.v. peter watches with his uncle ben, a paunchy 65 years old in polyester slacks and a comfy old sweater. a n.y. mets cap is perched on bens head. a beer can is in his hand. a cluttered but familiar living room sprawls comfortably around them."
ben,another brewski?
peter,"no, im fine, uncle ben."
ben,"(at t.v.) yah! way to do it. alright! (to peter) you dont follow the mets like you used to, do you, pete?"
peter,"no, not so much anymore."
ben,"funny. when your mom and dad, uh, passed away... i had this idea... i wanted you to be the best baseball player that ever was. geez, what ever happened to that?"
peter,little league.
ben,(soft and warm) yeah... babe ruth you wasnt.
narrator,aunt may enters.
aunt may,its on the table! turn off the tv!
narrator,"ben nods, rises sluggishly and slowly, and turns the sound off only. peter moves toward his aunt in the doorway."
aunt may,"hows that girl you told us about, peter?"
peter,liz? shes great... but she has a boyfriend.
narrator,int. the dining room - night peter passes aunt may and takes his seat.
aunt may,a boy your age should have a girlfriend.
peter,aunt may... she has a steady boyfriend.
aunt may,"peter, any girl thats worth your attention is of course gonna have a boyfriend... but if she really gets to know what you have to offer shell... you get my drift?"
ben,"look, just leave him alone, okay. when hes ready for girls hell be a holy terror. (winks) its in the blood. (now serious business) lookit, how are you fixed for money, pete? maybe i can help you out a little."
peter,"(lying to them) no, im alright. my scholarship covers almost everything, and i sell some photos here and there. today my physics professor asked for some of my work... he wants to study my data. they might publish my work in the science magazine... thatll bring me some money..."
ben,(practically cheering) publish your work?! you hear that may...?
peter,"(embarrassed laughs) yeah, in fact i have to leave a little early tonight, to meet professor octavius... he offered me to be his assistant..."
ben,whoa! did you hear that may...?
aunt may,"oh, peter, you promised youd spend the night..."
peter,"i... i cant, aunt may. professor octavius wants to discuss my new findings."
aunt may,"(disappointed) peter, what you should be finding... is a nice girlfriend."
narrator,int. basement cyclotron room - night weiner is eating a large sandwich and a drinking a coke.
ock,ill show them... closing the cyclotron on me... weiner!
weiner,"yes, professor..."
ock,where is he? its ten past eight oclock...
narrator,a knock
weiner,(with mouth full) that must be him. he opens the door.
peter,good evening.
ock,"you are late. (to weiner) weiner, go outside and get us something to eat. and dont steal it! just buy it. ill reimburse you."
weiner,(to peter) do you want anything parker?
peter,"no thank you, i just had dinner at my aunts..."
ock,"piss off, weiner!"
narrator,"weiner leaves. peter wanders around. he goes into the experimental chamber, he overlooks the spider which is scuttling away and crawls inside the open window... and into the chamber."
ock,"okey, dokey, parker... how would you like to take weiners place... i mean, be my assistant?"
peter,"well, professor, that would be a great honor, but im already working with..."
ock,"rosomorf... that imbecile. dont you understand, kid, that i am about to uncover the greatest discovery since einstein came up with his theory of relativity... the ""anti-force."""
peter,wow! the theory of the anti-force! you should go for the noble prize professor...
ock,"noble shmoble, i am going for a much bigger prize kid. okey, dokey. let me show you, kid, what i got here."
narrator,ock begins the experiment. we move in past the shattered window. we see the spider crawling on the chambers gear.
ock,"present maximum anti-force power to date is 38 percent of theoretical limit. i have patched in the variable particle-wave accelerator... (shrugs) i will now try to reach 50% power... (big breath) and if your paper has any value... i can use it to get the power im missing to create the anti-force, to break through and beat any other form of power in our or any other universe, capish!"
peter,"sorry, professor, i cant do it. i gave my word to professor rosomorf."
narrator,"ock is angry... ock now sees the spider. he shoots out a waldo to try and crush it but the spider is too fast. the waldo slams against the wall of the chamber. he starts to push every button or switch in sight. a deafening whining starts. an urgent warning tone causes ock to look at the ""relative gravity"" dial. it is at ""4.999999kg"" but suddenly the numbers start to tumble rapidly. insert: the glowing 5kg weight. insert: the power dial inches toward 50% power!"
ock,"(screaming) 50 percent... anti-force... 50 percent... thats all im missing! parker, we can be rich together!"
peter,sorry... id better go now.
ock,"(really angry now) youll be sorry, parker."
narrator,"peter leaves. another urgent warning tone causes ock to look at the monitor screen. on it, flashing red, is the word, ""overload!"" ock pushes the red power throttle forward! the whine increases to a pulse and throb. int. experimental chamber - night incredibly lit, the spider is dropping on its shimmering web-strand down toward the 5kg weight which now glows in time with the throb and pulse. int. the control room - night the monitor is flashing ""maximum overload - shut down!"" ock continues with the experiment. and then he sees the spider!"
ock,"you! get out of there, you creeping..."
narrator,he tries to shove the spider with his hand. int. experimental chamber - night through the blue-white we can barely make out ock on the other side if the shattered window. he sends two waldos after the spider. the spider evades him and jumps onto the professors back. it then climbs onto the professors neck and bites him.
ock,(anguish) noooooooooooo!
narrator,"the gravity dial goes to .000001, then pops back up as ocks tiny world goes berserk. dials spin, crack, explode or droop liquidly. wires dance on the console which erupts like the 4th of july. ock begins to float. his shirt begins to tear away. a dial floats by with its pulled wires undulating like a medusa. waldos smash through the walls and flail like snakes. ocks yellow thermos distorts and explodes! ock, his hair wild, face locked in a multi-g grimace, is pinned halfway up a wall that is showering the room with sparks."
ock,(ecstasy above the din) its an energy storm! okey! dokey!
narrator,"we see clearly the spider still stuck to his neck. the big beast buffets and shakes. tubes, junctions, valves and whatnot fall off, crashing to the floor where they twitch and writhe with a life of their own. then, an enormous explosion rips a large hole in the cyclotrons side, sending debris and a hundred micro- streams of electronic particles lancing in our direction. int. basement hallway - night ultimate weirdness! the pulsing blue-white light penetrates first the door of the cyclotron room and then the very walls! lockers bang, lamps pop, the ceiling sags in a surreal, rubbery way. the walls sag too! the cyclotron sign pivots and embeds itself in a wall. a ladder sinks in the wall. the blue- white light dances wildly about in pulses. then, suddenly, it stops... dead silence. weiner comes running in holding a double decker sandwich and a large bottle of pepsi. weiner enters ocks lab, singing, not at first noticing whats going on. suddenly he stops dead. int. cyclotron room - night a scene out of dalis surrealistic canvas. there are things inside of other things. dials look like dali watches. this place has been rippled to the max! ock lays face up, unconscious on the floor, a waldo across his chest. the spider is weaving its web. camera slowly down to see ock. pipes and wires are stuck to his body. the waldo seems to be wrapping him. he wakes up to see those mechanical arms buried in his body. they weave around him as if they are looking for prey. he tries to tear them out, but they seem to be a part of his body, like his other limbs. he screams. suddenly weiner sees ock."
weiner,professor... what happened to you? what did you do...
narrator,suddenly one of the waldos hits him so strongly that he flies back and out through the door to the corridor. int. basement hallway - night
weiner,oh my god... what happened here...
narrator,"he hears the police sirens approaching, he runs away."
weiner,i better get out of here.
narrator,"ext. the empire university - night the long scream segues to a police siren. a cop car pulls to a halt in front of the college. many nypd cars are already there, along with a nuclear regulatory van, some ambulances, a van from the environmental protection agency and two tv vans. roz runs across the lawn. police struggle to hold back the crowd of press, students and general gawkers. j. jameson pushes to the front of the mob in time to see two cops hustle a bugle photographer back into it. the man shakes his head. jameson throws down his cigar, stomps it, and pulls out a fresh one. thorkel arrives to address the crowd."
thorkel,"(through bull horn) there is no danger. please go back to your dorms. i repeat, there is no danger."

thorkel,who are you?
jameson,"jameson, daily bugle, chief editor, now what really happened here?"
thorkel,there will be a press announcement in the morning mr. jameson... now if youll excuse me.

thorkel,"i have nothing to say... there will be an announcement. now, please go home... everybody... we must clear the grounds..."

narrator,"ext. science center - night peter approaches a cyclone fence keeping low and out of sight. he leaps it like a skirmisher but fails ignominiously in a heap. hes torn his pants and cut his leg. he moves to the side of the building. a dumpster sits next to a fire door. its locked. as peter mulls over his next move, the lock clicks and the door slowly opens. peter leaps on the dumpster... and falls in. int. dumpster - night peter lays in the garbage, a pained look on his face. he rolls over and comes face to face with a wet daily bugle. the headline reads, ""wave of violence rips city!"" he pulls himself up and peers out. he sees a uniformed guard hold the door open for three men in radiation suits who remove some weirdly fused objects. when they let the door swing closed, peter stops it by inserting the newspaper in the top. ext. fire door - night peter squeezes inside and jumps to knock out the newspaper. the door closes behind him. int. basement hallway - night skewed, strange, surreal, peter stares at the weirdness and fumbles with his camera. he snaps off a few shots, then freezes when he hears a familiar voice."

thorkel,what was that?
roz,what was what?
thorkel,what hit me?
roz,what hit you?
thorkel,i dont know. it was so fast.
roz,"youre going to be fine, otto."
narrator,"peter gets off a shot and ducks into the mens room leaving the door ajar for a peak. a waldo slips down from the sheet. peters eyes go wide at the sight. what in the hell has happened here? int. mens room - night the urinals are twisted in bizarre shapes. pipes are exposed and spout water. the mirrors look like something out of a funhouse. peter hears the stretcher go by. peter goes to the door of ocks lab and cracks it. pan up to the spider, glowing softly, dangling from a shimmering strand above peter. as peter looks out at the stretcher, the spider drops on his neck. he reacts by swatting it away. bad move. the glowing spider now squats malevolently on the back of peters hand. he stares at it transfixed. it bites."
peter,ow!!!
narrator,"peter throws the spider to the ripply tile floor where it scuttles unsteadily out the door. sweat starts to bead on peters face. he shakes his head to clear it. his vision becomes uncertain. he lurches against a weird sink. peters pov is not just uncertain, not just fuzzy, not just moving in and out anamorphically. its all of that!"
guard,"(heavily distorted) hey! what are you doing here, kid?"
narrator,peter turns to see a uniformed guard distorted by his crazy vision.
peter,i feel a little funny...
guard,"(heavily distorted) yeah? well, i aint laughing. get out... just get out of here..."

jameson,"(winks) good job, kid. bizarre is what we need. pick this up in the morning. (holding up his camera) therell be two crisp twenties tucked inside."
narrator,"he hurries off. peter peers after him and all of a sudden his vision corrects to a perfect focus. the sweat is gone. hes okay. he makes his way through the crowd to the street. we track with peter as the madding throng recedes behind him. he turns a corner. he hears a siren. an ambulance screeches around the corner. it nearly hits peter who leaps to avoid it. ext. brick building - night peters cheek is pressed against the brick. he opens his eyes and sees that hes hanging onto the side of the building like a spider. and hes three stories up! he looks down and sees the street thirty feet below him! and the ambulance which he jumped over is driving away. he tries a downward step, but a brick dislodges and crashes to the sidewalk. he takes an upward step. and then another. tentatively at first, and then with growing confidence, he ""crawls"" to the roof of the building. at the top he gropes for a railing and slips. he dangles eight stories above the street. then, with a grunt, he vaults to the roof one-handed. ext. the roof - night peter is flat on his back, staring at the stars. he sits up and looks wonderingly at his hands. on the back of his right hand are two puncture wounds surrounded by a faint blue-white pulsing glow. the glow disappears."
peter,"(mutters to himself) this is weird. my god, i feel so weird..."
narrator,"he leaps to his feet. he flexes. feels weird. good weird. in fact, great weird! he tries a couple of ""jumping jacks"" and on the third jump he soars into the air!"
peter,(exhilarated) very weird.
narrator,"the great, bespangled, new york city is his backdrop as peter jumps and turns and does loops in the air. with the agility and tactility of a spider, peter leaps from the railing to a wall to a flag pole to another wall where he lands sideways and sticks."
peter,"(sideways) very, very weird."
narrator,"he leaps off the wall and lands at the edge of the roof. he looks down. no ones looking back. so, he takes a step back and leaps the alley to the next roof. ext. rooftop shack - night peter lands on it. the next roof is seven stories up and across the street. peter bites his lip."
peter,"well, what the hell!!"
narrator,"ext. the taller building - night backlit by a full moon, peter somersaults to the roof of the taller building, and misses the top! he sticks to the brick facade, upside down! he laughs with the moment. a window opens below him and a pretty blonde in a towel sticks her head out. she looks this way and that, and all she sees is a man in a loud sportcoat down the street. never thinking to look up, she withdraws into the room. ext. chelsea street - night the man in the loud sportcoat leans against a lamp post and lights a cigarette with a beat up, silver plated lighter. in the lighter he sees a reflection of peter leaping off the taller building. he snaps around and looks up in time to see peter make it to the next facade. ext. rooftop montage - night with the uptown skyline behind him, peter casts caution to the wind and leaps from rooftop to rooftop. watching from the street, the man in the loud sportcoat follows peters progress. peter leaps to a brownstone and lands amid the wash. he leaps up to a tenement and lands on a billboard across which he does a ""bug crawl"" and leaps again. he touches down on a pigeon coop and bounds up and out of frame again. the coop owner, a latino in an undershirt and a yankees cap, comes running out of the coop. hes so surprised that he leaves the door open and twenty white morning doves fly away in a furious flapping, free at last. the latino lets out a stream of hispanic expletives complete with all the appropriately obscene gestures. peter slides down a cable to a lamp post, and swirls down the pole to a phone booth. ext. phone booth - night peter comes face to face with the man in the loud sportcoat. he gives peter his card."
reiss,"youre a kid whos going places, and im gonna point you the right way."

spider-man,"put her down, ock."
narrator,"ock looks across the street. there, on the top of a tall building, is spider-man."
spider-man,"i know whats happening to you, ock. ive been through a lot of changes myself lately. you have to listen to me."
ock,(holding liz) who the hell are you?
spider-man,spider-man.

spider-man,im a good friend of peter parkers ock. just like that girl youre holding. now let her go.
narrator,"ock thinks for a moment, then he begins to extend the kicking and screaming liz out over the street, ten stories up."
ock,"let her go? what an excellent idea. if you do not deliver your friend, mr. spider-man, yes. yes, of course, ill let her go."
liz,"put me down, you mechanical mutant!"
narrator,"liz is having none of this. she kicks, she fights. she twists. she flails around, making things a little worse. the ground is yawning death beneath her. rriipp! part of her blouse tears away and liz plummets! spider-man swoops down on a web-strand in his characteristic compound curve. he reaches out for the falling liz and misses her cleanly. the web is too short."
liz,(falling away) you jerk!
narrator,he thwips her with a second web and together they swing to a high girder where he deposits her safe and sound.
liz,(straightening herself) tell your friend peter next time ill get the taxi myself...
ock,"(screams) hey... you jerk... you phony spider-man... prepare to meet your death, bug."

spider-man,"(whispers) actually, im rather fond of living... especially now... (he looks at liz)"
narrator,"he lands on ocks girder and the two progeny of the cyclotron face off for the first time, ten stories above the street."
spider-man,(a last appeal to reason) octavius. just stop and think.
ock,"i am thinking, insect. im thinking about exterminating you!"
spider-man,"okay, if thats the way you want it... lets see what those chrome knuckles can do, doc..."
narrator,a waldo lances out and catches spidey flush on the jaw. it knocks him to another girder. spidey hangs on and rolls over. he rubs his jaw.
liz,great...
narrator,spidey gets ready to go into action and gets pummeled by another barrage of blows from above.
ock,"now i must kill you, you cretinous clown."
narrator,"ock throws a roundhouse waldo that nearly knocks spidey off the girder. hes just barely hanging on. but spider-mans not done yet. he thwips a high beam and swings into a better attack position. the two super- adversaries engage in battle. with ock swinging from his waldos like a metal monkey and spidey swinging from his webs like, well, like spidey, they clang and bang through the girders of the construction site."
ock,"once i dispose of you, spider-man, no one will be able to stop me."
spider-man,stop you from what...?
ock,my destiny!

narrator,"insert: the computer screen displays peter parkers name and id number and the title, ""the planetary conjunction and its effect on earth gravity."""
ock,"yes, yes! go on! go on!"
narrator,"insert: number sequences appear on the screen. then a graphic of the earth moving into line with saturn, jupiter, the sun and the moon. in the corner a number rises."
ock,"enormous. its enormous. (to recorder) the parker calculations add 4% gravitational force at the moment of full planetary conjunction. (hits some keys) adding this to present maximum power potential, i get..."
narrator,"he looks up and sees the screen a graphic ""hole"" opening up right through the earth! the widening hole is swallowing everything!"
ock,i knew it. i knew it! universal destruction! its doable! i am putting a countdown clock on the planetary conjunction now!

peter,my planetary conjunction papers... they were stolen...
harry,oh my god... are you sure...? who would do such a thing?
peter,ock...
harry,of course... but why...?
peter,"we have to find out, sit down. (indicates computer) i want to access dr. octavius main program. i want to know about his experiments with the cyclotron. can you do it?"
harry,(starts hacking) i can try. i could access the system in the dorm. okay. and through that i could crack the main line.
peter,alright. now if we can just disrupt the octavius file...
harry,"okay, lets try."
narrator,harry cracks his knuckles like a safe cracker and bends to the task. the phone rings. peter hits his jerry-rigged speaker phone. harry keeps hacking.
peter,yeah?

harry,"i dont know, but whatever it is, its only six hours away."
peter,the planetary conjunction?
harry,could be...
peter,or doc ocks end of the world experiment... or both!
harry,wait a minute. youre not telling me you think the world is gonna end tonight...?
peter,you want to wait around till midnight to find out?
harry,"no, but..."
peter,lets see what else weve got.
narrator,another set of numbers roll up on the screen. they are accompanied by electrical symbols.
harry,whats that?
peter,it might be a calculation of the amount of power he needs to create the hole between the force and the anti-force.
harry,thats a lot of energy. what could generate power like that?

liz,"oh, you know peter... hes all caught up in some kind of study hes doing. things are really crazy at the university now. things are crazy... everywhere. i guess peters just... well, you know... pulled into his shell."
aunt may,"(reminiscing) when peter was little, he loved to hide. in the closets. under the sink. he always needed a secret place. but when id look for him, hed always laugh... he wanted to be found."
liz,"yeah... well. i dont think he wants me to find him... well, id better be going. my friend flash is picking me up."

spider-man,"hey, you big ock, why dont you pick on someone your own size?!"
ock,alright spider-bug... here ive come for you...

spider-man,"(to himself) okay now, spidey. easy does it."
narrator,"he shoots a web about halfway up the pit. it hits the wall, sizzles, and drops back down."
spider-man,"(to himself) dont give up, spidey. dont give up."
narrator,"the web gizmo squirts out a pathetic patooey of web goo. then it hisses, empty!"
spider-man,empty... now what do i do?

spider-man,"hes got the plutonium, and hes on his way back to the lab! and hes got two prisoners with him... liz and flash!"
harry,dont worry... he needs a huge amount of power... thousands of volts of electricity... to get to the anti-force.
spider-man,"he can get to the power. electrical power... to the max. nuclear power... sl 270. and now, at the moment of full planetary conjunction. when all the planets line up with the sun... maximum gravitational power. the conjunction is ocks final power source."

narrator,"harry hurries to kims side and elbows her out of the chair. the screen is flashing ""warning, security breach!"" harrys hands fly over the keys. the kids gather around. line drawings of the cyclotron (progressing from large to small detail) appear one after the other. finally, a pipe. there is a circle around a joint. and the legend ""h20""."
harry,a goddamn water leak...
flash,"hey, look at this. empire state university. this is our cyclotron, right?"
harry,(serious) what does it say?
flash,"(hits two keys) it says ""no information on net."""
harry,damn... we cant do it...
kim,you mean... we cant stop loony ock...
harry,i mean the world is in danger...
flash,"we must find peter, he knows these computers better than all of us."
harry,"yes, but where the hell is he?"
liz,(mysteriously) i bet he is with spider-man...
narrator,"suddenly the lights dim. a heavy noise. an earth quake. ext. outer space - perpetual dark the earth is moving into line with the other planets of the conjunction. ext. science center - night harry and flash and liz and kim, (the earth is shaking) come out running from the building beneath an enormous hanging moon. they are frightened. suddenly it all stops. its quiet, the kids look at the sky."
liz,look at the moon... i have never seen it so big.
flash,what is that...
harry,must be the sun.
narrator,"we now see the sky. with the sun on one side, and the moon on the other. they watch it, shocked, frightened out of their wits. ext. end of the world montage - night suddenly from ocks basement lab a blue beam of light breaks through. a whine starts, it moves magically out of the window and pans around a sleepy new york which doesnt know that the end is upon it. the dreaded whine builds throughout! people stop in their tracks, look up to the strange looking skyline. camera comes down to a street where roz is driving spider-man fast toward the university. int. rozs car - night roz looks out over the skyline of new york. lighted buildings flare up and then go dark. the lighted spire of the empire state building flares up and explodes."
spider-man,"its started. step on it professor, or well never make it."
narrator,they look across the campus and a strange light is coming out of the science center.
roz,our campus... right there... see those beams from ocks lab. were late... its coming... the conjunction will happen in a few seconds.
narrator,spider-man massages his arm.
spider-man,stop the car...! come with me.
roz,where...? what...?
narrator,"spider-man shoots out a web and flies toward the school building taking roz with him. int. experimental chamber - night it is a patchwork of make-shift repairs. ock looks in through a window thats been melted out. he is lost in a mad rapture. int. control room - night red power throttle is at 95% power! spider-man and roz enter, shielding their eyes from the glare. the countdown clock reads, ""00:08:18""."
ock,"(looking back, madly) aha! you never included the conjunction in your calculations, did you?! rosomorf!"
roz,"damn the calculations! my god, otto, you have to hear me! the world we know will collapse! everything we have devoted our lives to... all the patterns, all the harmonies... everything will be destroyed."
ock,a new world waits! rosomorf! it is my destiny!!!
roz,it is cosmic suicide! you have no right!
narrator,"roz flings himself through the melted window into the experimental chamber. he grabs for the ""bullet"" but the waldos grab him and throw him back. roz staggers backward... into the arms of spider-man."
roz,you have to stop him... spider-man you have to stop him.
spider-man,im afraid were too late.
narrator,"spider-man attacks ock, trying to push him away from the throttle. ock pushes spider-man away from him so strongly that spider-man is knocked down. ock nudges the power throttle forward and the whine increases to an ear shattering pitch. the countdown clock reads, ""00:06:48"". we are at 96% power! ext. the science center - night we pan down from the moon to a street full of sirens and shadowy figures running in the night. liz and kim and harry come nearer. a very weird light is emanating from the center."
liz,hes in there. i know peter is in there. she breaks into a run.
flash,"liz, dont... liz come back... come back! liz runs inside. they run after her. a bolt of electricity flashes across the doorway, stopping them."
narrator,"int. the control room - night the planets are playing on the computer screen. things in the room begin to rise, weightless. the energy storm is brewing!"
ock,"okey, dokey!! my energy storm has started. my anti-force is on! history is being made... spider-man, rosomorf cheer up friends... were on our way to the unknown cosmos... we three are about to visit heaven... real gods heaven."
roz,(sees the sky through the window) spider-man! the conjunction! its happening!
narrator,ext. the sky - strange colors - night the conjunction is now happening. insert: surreal dials spin madly. int. science center - night liz runs into a hallway gone berserk. stuff is flying everywhere. tiles pull from the walls and crash to the ceiling.
liz,"peter! peter, where are you?!"
narrator,"int. control room - night ock throws the red power throttle to 97% power. cacophony! the ""bullet"" begins to pulse and throb! the dials spin! the countdown clock reads, ""00:05:58"". ext. science center - night the full moon hangs over the building. flash and harry and kim stand at the entrance to the center. flash starts to run to the building."
flash,(screaming) liz! liz come on out!
narrator,"they run forward but as they reach the front steps the building lurches upward. the bottom step becomes a wall of stone and dirt, six feet high."
harry,get back! flash... get back!
flash,wow...!
narrator,then the building lurches upward again! this time it pulls free from the ground. the kids take cover as water lines burst and electrical wires spark. int. science center hallway - night liz opens a door.
liz,peter!
narrator,"the building lurches throwing her back across the hall where she crashes through another door. int. chemistry lab - night all manner of stuff is flying around. liz comes sliding across the floor. she crashes into a cabinet. glassware starts to fall on her, but crashes into the ceiling instead. she is dragged up the wall. she kicks and screams against the anti-force. ext. science center - night flash, kim and harry look on as heavy electrical cables stretch upward to the rising center and then snap in showers of sparks. as they fall away the center becomes airborne. the cables wave up at it, shooting arcs of electricity directly at the building. int. chemistry lab - night liz slides down the wall. she grabs at the window and looks out. the rest of the university recedes beneath her, now a hundred feet below. and theyre still rising! flash and harry look up."
flash,oh my god... liz is inside there!
harry,and professor rosomorf and crazy ock.
flash,what about peter? is he there with them?
harry,"no, but i bet spider-man is."
narrator,"ext. street in front of university - night people look up at the science center. a cyclist, riding and looking, crashes into a taxi. max reiss leaps out with the beautiful starlet from the taxi."
max,thats some show... if ever i saw one.
narrator,int. jamesons office - night hes looking out his window seeing the universitys lab building flying by. up and up toward the sky.
jameson,(shouting) tear out the front page! change the headline... the biggest news is happening right now... we need photos... a camera... get me a camera...!
narrator,"ext. sky - night a very long shot of the science center rising into the clouds. int. aunt mays bedroom - night she pulls aside a curtain and watches the science center rise. int. control room - night ock works the computer as the console sends up showers of sparks. he glances at the ""bullet"" which now pulses. the countdown clock at ""00:04:18""."
roz,where is it going otto?
ock,"other worlds, roz, other times, other dimensions, who knows? who cares?"
roz,then... why?
ock,"truth, rosomorf. look at it! the new truth! the new way!"
spider-man,dont listen to him professor roz.
ock,"no, you dont listen to that clown, he cant save you, or the world for that matter."
narrator,"a waldo reaches in and rips roz off spidey, flinging him back against a wall. roz lands in a heap beneath a fire station (hose, extinguisher, axe). we see the waldo reach out for spider-man. it wraps around his foot and begins to tug, slowly..."
ock,"once and for all, spider-man... once and for all well end the legend of your powers."
narrator,ock knocks spider-man with a real big blow with his waldo. ock is slowly dragging spider-man to a huge hole thats been ripped in the floor by the beams of electricity. we see new york a half a mile down through the hole. we see spidey being drawn across the hole. then roz comes flying in with the fire axe. roz hacks away at the waldo and chops it off! the stump withdraws. ock examines it in pain and fury!
ock,(ultimate betrayal) you!! you were my teacher!!!
narrator,"roz doesnt even look back. he and spidey are at the edge of the hole and hes shaking spidey furiously. ock sends out his other waldo and begins banging it on the floor in a frenzy on either side of roz and spidey. like a child denied, he smashes his steel fists against the floor again and again."
ock,you were my teacher! and you want to destroy my experiment. you are a scientist for heaven sake... dont you want to know whats up there?
roz,"yes, but not on account of our world. we have only one world... only one life. the floor begins to craze and then crack like ice around a hole on a pond. bang! bang! spidey comes to just as the section of floor beneath himself and roz gives way and falls through."
narrator,"spidey grabs hold of the edge and dangles. he looks down and sees roz falling away beneath him, disappearing into the dark."
roz,(calling back from the dark skies) spider-man! only you can save us now...
spider-man,roz!!! (turns to ock) murderer!!!
ock,"forget that old fool, insect. my spider-man... come join me on my fantastic voyage to the 7th heaven."
narrator,ext. outer space - perpetual dark the planets are virtually in line! int. science center hallway - night liz comes running through it. a bolt of electricity shoots from the right to the left in front of her. she slams on the brakes and runs the other way.
liz,peter! peter!
narrator,"int. control room - night the countdown clock is at, ""00:02:59"". ock throws the power throttle to 98% power. he laughs and a web splats against his glasses. spidey scrambles to his feet. ock, still trying to get the web goo off his glasses, is slammed into the console by spider-man. sparks fly and waldos flail blindly, smashing things. ock tears off his glasses and squints through the fire and smoke and glare. spider-man thwips the ceiling and swings into a drop kick! ock recovers. he grabs spidey and slam dunks him through the hole in the floor. ext. the bottom of the building - night spider-man falls through the air. he shoots up a web and thwips, it sticks to the rocky bottom of the foundation. ock appears in the hole. he sees spideys dilemma, hanging on a thread of web. a half-broken waldo snakes down and clips the web. but the web sticks to the waldo! ock shakes it, but he cant get loose. spider-man shoots out another web at the rock bottom and, with the leverage, he pulls ock out. ock swings down in a wide arc and his waldos catch on the rock upside down. he holds on fiercely. ock scrambles out to the side of the center and begins looking for an entry. spider-man is right on his tail. the building pitches sideways! ock turns to face spider- man, his broken waldos out for battle. spidey grabs an exposed pipe and breaks it off, brandishing it like a broad sword."
spider-man,"lets have it, old boy! a bizarre duel takes place. the center pitches this way and that. spidey and ock move from foothold to foothold, from window to ledge to parapet."
narrator,"now the center pitches to a 45 degree angle. they duel upside down! a window grate crashes open and liz comes flying out, holding onto the grate for dear life!"
spider-man,liz!! ock seizes the opportunity to whack spidey across the head. spidey loses his footing but the building now lurches back and liz goes flying back inside. spidey ducks inside too and pulls the grate.
narrator,spider-man uses his great strength to move a huge piece of scientific machinery in front of the grate.
spider-man,come on.
liz,wheres peter? he must be here somewhere.
spider-man,"(pulling her ahead) hes around, dont worry... well find him."
narrator,"int. control room - night the countdown clock is at, ""00:01:00"" as spidey comes flying in with liz in tow."
liz,this building is flying. im in a goddamn flying building...
spider-man,i think we have to pull some of these cables. try those over there. ill work on these. we gotta slow this thing down somehow. we got helicopters coming.
narrator,"liz looks at some wiring, apprehensive about even touching it."
spider-man,pull!
narrator,"she yanks out a cable. the building pitches. but when spidey pulls one out, it rights itself. ext. science center - night the big beams start cutting out one by one. the center begins to pitch and yaw. the choppers are getting closer. int. control room - night the countdown clock reads, ""00:00:15"" as spidey and liz continue to pull wires and cables. two waldos erupt through the floor and grab spidey. they pull spidey to the floor. entangled in these molybdimum pythons, spidey struggles valiantly. liz leaps to his aid."
liz,oh my god...
narrator,"a third waldo, a broken one, snakes up from the hole and begins feeling blindly around on the console for the power throttle."
spider-man,the power!
narrator,"liz sees the damaged waldos heading for the red throttle. the countdown clock is at ""00:00:10"". liz leaps and tries to wrestle it away. it whips in her arms and she holds on tight. it bangs her against the wall and then the console. she holds on. ""00:00:03"". the waldo crashes liz against the wall which erupts in sparks. she lets go of it. it heads for the power throttle! ""00:00:01!"" spider-man cant break the grip of the waldos, but he can pull with super-human strength. he yanks ock up through the stone floor. ock hits the ceiling of the control room. one waldo grabs on. the other one throws the red power throttle!"
ock,"spider-man. youre end is coming. life in its present form is ending... new dimensions, new horizons..."
narrator,the universal bullet begins to glow. the glow sharpens to a point of light. spider-man holds on tight against a rushing energy flow thats pulling everything in the room towards the point of light.
liz,(bracing against the storm) what is happening?
spider-man,(similarly braced) i dont know!!!
narrator,liz starts to slip away into the flow. she struggles against it.
liz,i cant... hold on!
narrator,spidey thwips her and she grabs onto the web.
spider-man,"hold tight, liz, hold tight!"
narrator,"ock drops calmly, beatifically, to the floor of the room. he moves slowly, under his own power, into the light."
ock,"(spaced out) you cut my power... theres too little power... its so tiny... so tiny... theres only space... for me. but ive done it, spider-man. i have broken through... ive broken through!"
liz,"dont do it, dr. octavius!"
ock,okey... dokey... now thats what i call an experiment!!!
narrator,"as he nears the light he actually becomes a part of it. he radiates light. he shimmers and shines. he fills the room with blinding light. spidey and liz shield their eyes, and as the light diminishes, the storm subsides. theyre safe. except for the fact that theyre in a floating building, 10,000 feet above the city! ext. science center - night against the backdrop of the moon, a squadron of helicopters approaches the center. from their pov, a huge crack opens across the face of the building. the center begins to drop in pulsing surges. int. control room - night spider-man is at the console pulling and putting back wires. liz, fascinated, looks in at the window where ock disappeared."
spider-man,i cant control her. shes dropping too fast! alright... lets go!
liz,but what about peter? weve got to find peter!
spider-man,"peter will be okay, i promise you... lets go before its too late. (he grabs her)"
liz,go where?
narrator,"ext. the center - night it rotates and drops. the helicopters come in like the cavalry. int. control room - night trying to leave it, liz and spidey are confronted with a nightmare. the room is tilted at a 45% angle. pipes are bursting. spidey helps liz through the obstacles. debris rains down. they come face to face with a diagonal maze of pipes."
spider-man,maybe theres another way...
narrator,a huge crack opens above them.
liz,its breaking apart!
spider-man,"alright, keep moving, a step at a time!"
narrator,"they scale the maze, but as they emerge on the other side, half the floor falls away! central park awaits, 8,000 feet below."
liz,we have to go back.
spider-man,we cant go back.
narrator,he looks across at the door. it is midway up a diagonal wall. he shoots a web up at the ceiling between themselves and the door. then he extends a hand to liz.
liz,forget it...
spider-man,"okay, have it your way."
narrator,"he swings across and lands on the ledge of the door. then he swings the web back to her like a trapeze. liz catches the web and looks across at spider-man, furious."
liz,(shouting across) what am i supposed to do with this!
spider-man,(shouting back) go ahead. its easier than it looks! weve got to try the fire escape.
narrator,"liz swings across like tarzan and spidey gathers her in on the ledge. she does a comic ""phew"" and the ledge buckles beneath them but holds. spider-man tries to open the door, but its stuck."
liz,the door is stuck.
narrator,"spider-man bends his back to the task. it take all his strength, but with a comic aaaaargghh! he bends the door open. ext. fire door - night they burst out onto the rock foundation of the building. new york is rushing up to meet them. the wind created by their fall buffets them. the helicopters arrive, and the falling building plunges right past them. the helicopters look across at each other, helpless. ext. the center - night it drops like a stone. ext. fire door - night spidey and liz are falling away from the door, sliding along the rock. liz is stopped by a retaining wall. spidey keeps sliding. he thwips the wall and then disappears over the edge. liz screams! liz fights to her feet and grabs onto the web stand. she pulls on it with all her strength. she pulls and pulls and pulls. we see the web running up between the rocks. she gives one last pull and comes up with an empty web end. a long, long beat."
peter,"liz, up here!"
narrator,liz looks up and sees peter hanging out the window two stories above her. he throws out a rope ladder. liz grabs it. she begins to climb. int. classroom - night peter pulls liz through the window. there is no time for an embrace.
peter,come on. ive found a way down.
liz,"(at long last, love) i knew you were going to say that."
narrator,"they run out of the room. we pan down and see, crumpled beneath the window, the spider-man suit. int. large physics lab - night this is the lab we saw in the opening sequence. peter has turned on the lights. hes got a handful of rope."
liz,wheres the way out?
peter,right there!
narrator,we are looking at the huge american flag.
peter,"come on, help me with this."
narrator,"ext. the foundation - night liz is already down the rope ladder and is holding it for peter. he comes down with a huge bundle of red, white & blue."
peter,"okay, stand still."
narrator,he ties some rope around her waist.
liz,is this going to work?
peter,how do i know?
liz,i just adore confidence in a man.
peter,come on...
narrator,they move to the edge of the rock and look down. central park is still a couple thousand feet down.
liz,what is it you say when you jump?
peter,your prayers.
narrator,"they scream as the building lurches again, knocking them to the ground. they start to slide across the rock. they reach out for each other but their hands dont quite reach. slowly, they inch back together, but the foundation cracks between them. ext. the center - night it spins and falls beneath us. down, down it goes. and then it crashes into the great lawn. a huge cloud of debris shoots upward. ext. the sky - night there is a beautiful full moon. peter and liz float down into the frame lit by its wonderful light. the american flag which has turned into a huge parachute. they hold each other tight. they can hear sirens below. they begin to laugh with relief. then they stop. the wind billows lizs skirt and plays with peters hair, and snaps in the american flag."
liz,we have a lot to thank your friend spider-man for.
peter,"somehow, i dont think weve seen the last of him."
liz,"peter...! finders, keepers..."
peter,what...? what is it? why do you look like that?
liz,i think im in love.
peter,(even his eyes blush) you are...
liz,with your friend...
peter,spider-man? youre in love with spider-man?
liz,i am... you think well see him again?
peter,we might... you never know. he kisses her.
liz,oh. (bittersweet) this may be the end of a beautiful friendship you know?
peter,nah.
