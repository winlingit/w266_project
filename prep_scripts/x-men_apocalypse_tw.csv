charles,"mutants, born with extraordinary abilities, and yet still, they are children, stumbling in the dark, searching for guidance. a gift can often be a curse. give someone wings, and they may fly too close to the sun. give them the power of prophecy, and they may live in fear of the future. give them the greatest gift of all, powers beyond imagination, and they may think they are meant to rule the world."
death,"soon, you will rule forever, my lord."
egyptian guard,death to the false god!
horsemen of apocalypse,watch over him!
teacher,"as everyone knows, the existence of mutants was first discovered during the paris peace accords after the vietnam war in 1973. 6 days later, we all watched as one of those mutants... erik lehnsherr, attacked the president and the cabinet on the lawn of the white house. their lives were saved by a young mutant, who stopped him. now, lehnsherr escaped and became the worlds most wanted fugitive. and as for her, she disappeared as well. but, she has become the symbol of a new age. the face of a world that will never be the same again."

magda,at the back. with her friends.
nina,"where did you learn that song, papa?"
erik,"i learned it from my parents. and they learned it from their parents. and them from theirs. and one day, you will sing it to you children too."
nina,"what happened to them, your parents?"
erik,"they were taken from me, when i was a little boy. but, they are still here, inside. and here... with you."

hank,"hey, scott. im hank mccoy. im one of the teachers here. (scott nods a little)"
alex,wheres the professor?
charles,"... to break forth bloodily, then the past must be obliterated and a new start made. let us now start fresh without remembrance, rather than live forward and backward at the same time. now, what are the aggrieve things that the author meant when he wrote all that? he... thats going to be your assignment for tomorrow. top marks, everyone. class dismiss. alex, its good to see you."
alex,"yeah, you too."
charles,you look... well. its been a while.
alex,it has. youre not too bad yourself.
charles,thank you.
alex,"this is my brother, scott."
charles,"hello, scott. welcome to the school for the gifted."
scott,yeah. it doesnt exactly feel like a gift.
charles,"it never does, not at first. the first step in understanding ones power is learning the extent of it. only then, can we begin the process of teaching you how to control it. if you do decide to stay, i can promise you that by the time you are done here youll be able to go back into the world and play a stable productive partner. why dont you take your bandages off and we can have a look at what were dealing with here. alex, would you line him up. face him in the right direction if you will. theres a target just across the water. when you open your eyes, try and hit that. you can open your eyes, scott. theres nothing to be afraid of. its quite... get back! get back. get back. whoa! my grandfather planted that tree when he was 5 years old. i used to swing from the branches then myself. i think that was probably my favourite tree."
scott,does that mean im expelled?
charles,on the contrary. youre enrolled.
moira,do you sell carpets?

charles,"back to bed, please, everyone. jessie, back to bed, please. come on, now. spitzbolt, back to bed. carrie anne, come on, now. back to bed. - ive never seen her like this. -"
hank,"well, i do."
charles,dont let any of the children come this way. jean. jean! jean !!! i...
jean,i saw the end of the world. i could feel all this death.
charles,nope. it was just a dream. -
jean,"but, it felt real. -"
charles,i know. your mind is the most powerful ive ever seen. - it can convince itself... -
jean,"no, its not just a mind reading or a telekinesis, its something else. some... dark power inside and its growing, like a fire. - i thought i was getting better. -"
charles,you are. you will. - you just have to be patient. -
jean,no. no. you dont know what its like to be afraid to shut your eyes. - to be trapped inside your own head. -
charles,"oh, but i think i do. it wasnt so long ago, that i was plagued by voices of myself. all their suffering. all their pain. their secrets."
jean,im afraid one day i am going to hurt someone.
charles,"lie back. everyone fears that which they do not understand. you will learn to control your powers. and when you do, youll have nothing to fear."
charles,her nightmares were different this time.
hank,"well, it could have count for something i saw while i was in my lab earlier. there was some kind of tremor. like an energy surge. - i picked it up on one of my meters. -"
charles,youre saying that jean created it.
hank,"no, im saying something else did. maybe she was reacting to it, i dont know. but, the epicenter was half way around the world."
charles,half way around the world?
hank,yeah. thats why i was hoping you could take a look.
charles,lets see what we can find.
computer,welcome professor.
hank,the source came from cairo. ill put in the coordinates.

charles,mm-hm.
hank,and give me the details?
charles,"well, she looks amazing. - shes barely aged a day."
hank,no. i meant... what is she doing there? whats the cia doing with this?
charles,"shes going back to langley to deliver a report. im going to go there, see if she knows something about the tremor."
hank,youll wind up seeing moira.
charles,"i want to go check her out, check out... the situation. moira mactaggert. its like a ghost from the past."
magda,"you did a good thing, you saved that man."
erik,"thats not the point. if im exposed, were all exposed. we have to go."
magda,this is our home. this is our daughters home.
erik,"we are her home. i told you who i was, the first night i met you. i trusted you then. i need you to trust me now. we cant stay here anymore."
magda,ill get nina.  sweetheart? shes not in her room. and i dont see her at the back.

erik,nina. are you okay?
police officer,she is fine.
erik,"then, let her go."
police officer,we will. we just wanted to talk.
erik,you are not wearing your badges. no metal.
police officer,"some men from the factory said they saw something today. something that made no sense. keep your weapons. you have been a good citizen, henryk. a good neighbor, good worker. - i believe you are."
magda,he is.
police officer,but nobody in town really knows who you are.
erik,"everyone knows. im henryk gurzsky. jacob, i even had dinner at his house."
jacob,and you lied all the time. i let a murderer in my house is that you? are you the one called magneto?
erik,i surrender. please. let my daughter go. go with your mother.
nina,please! dont leave me. - im not going to let them take you.
magda,nina. nina. nina. nina.
nina,please!
police officer,whats happening? she is one of them.
nina,please.
police officer,make her stop.
erik,she cant control them.
magda,nina.
nina,please.
erik,shes frightened.
nina,im not letting them take you! im not letting them take you!
police officer,make it stop!
magda,nina.
erik,"no. no, nina! . nina? nina. no. dont... please. please. please. what have you done? not my babies. not my babies. is this what you want from me? is this what i am? is this what i am"
merchant,you know what we do with thieves? choose a hand.
apocalypse,enough.
merchant,"if you are with her, i suggest you go away. go away."
apocalypse,who rules this world?
merchant,what language is that? clown! what do you want? go away! sorry. sorry.
apocalypse,"you feel it, dont you? now, you feel it. central intelligence agency united states of america"
alex,"so, you really havent seen her in all these years? you never looked her up? not even in cerebro?"
charles,"alex. who do you take me for? some kind of pervert? i... yes, i looked her up once. twice. but, not in a long time."
alex,alright? howd you leave things? - any hard feelings?
charles,"not likely. everybody take a break. i wiped her mind off all memories of us. the beach, cuba, that whole time. its so long ago, alex. before the world knew about mutants, i have felt... it was the best thing for her."
alex,and for you?
charles,it didnt really matter whats best for me. moira mactaggert.  hello.  allow me to introduce myself. im professor...
moira,charles xavier - i know exactly who you are.
charles,you do?
moira,of course i do. ive read all of your papers. its a pleasure to finally meet you.  - moira mactaggert.
alex,alex summers.
moira,"have a seat. just, throw that on the floor."
charles,its wonderful to see you again. to-to meet you again for the first time. i... you got a son? - yes. - does he have a husband or... do you have a husband?
moira,"i had a husband, but... its hard to do this job and make it home in time for dinner."
charles,"good. good. we all make choices, right?"
moira,"yes, we do. - professor. - yes?"
charles,yes. i was... we were hoping that you would tell us about what happened yesterday in egypt.
moira,"im afraid thats classified information. and, i dont mean to be rude, but... how did you get in here?"
charles,i have level 5 clearance.
moira,"ever since the world found out about mutants in 73, there have been cults who see them as some kind of second coming or sign of god. i was tracking one of them. they called themselves, ashir en sabah nur, named after an ancient being they believed to be the worlds first."
alex,the world firsts what?
moira,the worlds first mutant.
alex,i thought mutants didnt evolve until this century.
moira,"thats the common theory, yes. but, these guys believe that the first mutant was born tens of thousands of years ago. and they believe he will rise again. theyve been searching ancient sites all round the world for clues. these hieroglyphs described a specific set of powers greater than any man can possess."
alex,they think he lived all that time?
moira,"yes and no. they believe he had the ability to transfer his consciousness from body to body, and whenever he was close to death he would just take on a new body. so, these may have been the bodies of mutants enabling him to take their powers amassing varies abilities over the years."
charles,an all powerful mutant.
moira,"exactly. and wherever this being was, he always had 4 principle followers. disciples. protectors he would imbue their powers."
alex,like the four horsemen of the apocalypse. - he got that one from the bible.
moira,"or the bible got it from him. and wherever he ruled, eventually, it would end in disaster. cataclysm. some kind of... apocalypse."
charles,the end of the world.
star trek character,"i must say, apollo. the way you ape human behavior is remarkable."
storm,"get out. come one. come on. come on. ive never seen another mutant in this city. do you speak egyptian? arab? english? great fighter. shes my hero. i want to be like her. theres some food here, not much."
tv," i dont believe it. you love me. love you? be logical. im not some simple shepherdess you can awe. why, i could no more love you than i could love a new species of... bacteria."
storm,what are you doing?
apocalypse,learning.
reporter,"in the streets there is outrage against the soviet invasion of afghanistan... the brotherhood of our kind. one of them was held in boston. since the act in the nuclear weapons, the united states does not start fights..."
apocalypse,weapons?
reporter,never before has man possess so much power. with soviet union and the united states being superpowers...
apocalypse,"superpowers? the weak have taken the earth. for this, i was betrayed. false gods. idols. no more. i have returned. the new tomorrow, that starts today."
storm,where did you come from?
apocalypse,the time before man lost his way.
storm,well. welcome to the 80s.
apocalypse,this world needs to be... purged.
storm,what?
apocalypse,saved.
storm,"you cant save the world, just going around killing people. theres laws, system and place for that kind of thing."
storm,"my child, why do you enslave yourself?"
storm,what are you doing?
storm,making you stronger. my goddess.
storm,yes. you were right. the time has passed. there is no room for gods.

caliban,"always good to see your face, even if its not yours. papers and passage for me. where is the gentleman going, may i ask?"
raven,"dont matter, dont care. i just saved his life, what he does with it is up to him."
caliban,"mystique, the mercenary."
raven,dont call me that.
caliban,"no matter how much you pretend to be someone else, caliban knows who you are. if theres anything worth knowing about mutants, caliban knows it."
psylocke,mystique.
raven,why dont you ask your psychics what will happen if you keep pushing me.
caliban,"what will happen? psylocke gets a little jealous. - cause caliban likes you. - caliban likes money. caliban likes you so much, he wants to give you free information. about an old friend. from back when you have friends. do you remember, erik lehnsherr? my girls had a flash of him in poland. he left quite a few dead bodies in his wake, including his wife and daughter. should be on the news soon enough. but... caliban gives you a little head start."
raven,how fast are you?
kurt,how fast?
raven,how far can you cover?
kurt,"uh, as far as i can see, - or if ive been there before."
raven,come with me crawler.
kurt,"actually its nightcrawler, and my real name is... ... kurt wagner."

jean,"theyre not scared of you, theyre scared of me. youre not the only one who cant fully control your powers."
scott,"wait, so... last night, when the house shook... that was you?"
jean,"sorry to break it to you, but you are not the biggest freak of this school."
scott,well. thats a first.
hank,raven. wow. uh. - i... youre...
raven,not blue? its like you and i have that in common now.
hank,"no. no, i meant... youre... youre back. i never thought i would see you here again."

raven,"oh, right."
kurt,kurt wagner.
hank,welcome.
caliban,were closed. i knew i felt a chill in the air. how did you get in here?
storm,we let ourselves in.
apocalypse,"we are looking for mutants. since you know where to find them, we came here."
caliban,caliban doesnt know you.
apocalypse,we are looking for the strongest.
psylocke,everything alright?
caliban,"im fine, psylocke. how much money do you have?"
apocalypse,none.
caliban,"like caliban said... we are closed, yeah?"
apocalypse,"i need your help, my child."
caliban,you dont look calibans father. maybe a little bit up here.
apocalypse,"you are all my children. and you are lost, because you follow blind leaders. these false gods. systems of the weak. they ruined my world... ... no more."
psylocke,what do you want?
apocalypse,i want you... to feel the full reach of your power. youve only have a taste of your true strength. unlike others who seek to control you. i want to set you free.
psylocke,i know the kind of mutants you are looking for. and i know where to find them.
kurt,its my first time in america. i am very excited to see your culture.
jubilee,"well, you are not going to see it here. the only thing american about this place is that it used to be british. this is scott. he is new here too."
scott,and im already up for a prison break. what do you say we take this blue guy on a little field trip? im sure theres a mall around here somewhere.
kurt,whats a mall?
scott,whats a mall? alright. now its a matter of national pride. - civic duty.
jean,scott.
scott,what? youve been cooped up here for a long time. and the professor is not even home.
kurt,i-i like to go to the mall.
scott,try it. - alright. where does he keep his cars?
warren,"faire pisse. or should i say, ""piss off""?"
storm,this is the guy?
psylocke,he used to be. i didnt know his wings were... lets get out of here. his fighting days are done.
apocalypse,"no, theyre not."
warren,what the hell is this?
apocalypse,i want to give you something.
warren,there is nothing you can give me that i want.
apocalypse,"yes, there is. yes, my son. yes. rise, my angel. rise."
hank,"hypersonic, blast resistance, stealth technology."
raven,thats impressive. how are you ever gonna get it out of here?
hank,"well, thats okay. i built a retractable roof into the basketball court."
raven,"hank, youre building a warplane down here."
hank,"after what happened in washington, i thought we would come back to start the x-men. like we always talked about, but... charles wants students not soldiers. he thinks the best of people. he has hope."
raven,and you?
hank,"you know, i think we should hope for the best. and prepare for the worst. i think the world needs the x-men. maybe, now that youre back you can help me convince him - ... we can start it together."
raven,"hank, im here about erik."
hank," right. erik. yeah, of course. of course."
raven,i think he might be in some kind of trouble. real trouble.
hank,isnt he always?
erik,some of you spoke to the police... about what your believed you witnessed here yesterday. you want to know my past? know who i am? see what i can do? ill show you. think about the person you love most in your life. your wife. mother. daughter. now that person will know what it is to lose someone they love. and live with that pain. - forever.
worker,"henryk, please. dont do this."
erik,"my name isnt henryk. my name is magneto. who the fuck are you? stay back. whoever you are, dont try to stop me from killing these men."
apocalypse,im not here for them. im here for you. come and see. this is where your power was born. and this is where your people were slaughtered.
erik,you shouldnt have brought me here.
apocalypse,"why? are you afraid to be here? you cant escape it, erik."
erik,who are you?
apocalypse,"elohim, shen, ra. ive been called many names over many lifetimes. i am born of death. i was there to spark and fan the flame of mans awakening, to spin the wheel of civilization. and when the forest would grow rank and in need of clearing for new growth... i was there to set it ablaze."
erik,where were you? when my father and mother were slaughtered in this place?
apocalypse,"asleep. trapped in darkness. i was not there for you, my son. but i am here now. you dont know your own strength, but i do. reach down. feel the metal in the ground. reach, as deep as you can. youll find you have the power to move the very earth itself. everything theyve built will fall! and from the ashes of their world, well build a better one!"
reporter,"lehnsherr was identified yesterday in this small town, in central poland. leaders from all communities are urging their citizens to remain calm as police and armed forces are mobilizing to find lehnsherr before he can strike again. if anyone has information about lehnsherr, or as he is also known as magneto. contact you local authorities immediately. and proceed with caution. - as he is considered extremely dangerous."
peters mom,peter.
peter,whats up?
peters mom,im just checking on you.
peter,"im good, playing pac-man."
peters mom,are you sure you werent watching this?
reporter,the world was celebrating 10 years of peace between mutants and mankind.

moira,"ive read so much about this place. but being here, it actually seems kind of... ... familiar."
charles,its strange. - it could be quite. shall we? now playing the return of the jedi
jubilee,"im just saying, ""the empire"" is still the best. its the most complex, the most sophisticated, wasnt afraid to have a dark ending."
scott,"yeah, but come on. if it wasnt for the first one you wouldnt have any of the rest of the movies."
jean,"well, at least we can all agree the third one is always the worst."
charles,hank. you in here? id like you to meet the...
raven,moira.
charles,raven?
moira,"im sorry, have we met?"
charles,"hank, alex, agent mactaggert, would you give us just one moment please?"

charles,"well. after you left me on the beach in cuba, i took her memories of that time. have a sit."
raven,lucky girl.
charles,"its good to see you, raven. - welcome home."
raven,this isnt my house.
charles,it was once.
raven,"no, it was your home. i just lived here. i barely even recognize it now."
charles,"yeah, i have plans for this place. i mean to turn it into a real campus. a university. not just for mutants, even for humans too. living and working, ... growing together."
raven,"you know, i really believed that once. i really believed we can change them after dc."
charles,we did.
raven,no charles. they still hate and fear us. its just harder to see because theyre more polite about it. i got sick of living that lie.
charles,thats why youre not in your natural blue form.
raven,im not going to be the face of a world that doesnt exist.
charles,things are better. the world is better.
raven,"maybe in westchester. out there, mutants are still running, hiding, living in fear. just because theres not a war doesnt mean theres peace. if you want to teach your kids something, teach them that. teach them to fight. otherwise, they might as well live in this house for the rest of their lives."
charles,you still sound just like him. you sound just like erik.
raven,thats why im here. hes resurfaced. he had a wife and a daughter. they were killed. along with a handful of policemen. the whole world will be looking for him. but you can help me find him before they do.
charles,"moira, im going to have to ask you to keep this a secret."
moira,i dont even know what this... is.
raven,its cerebro. - the new model.
hank,yeah. i based the color on... it doesnt matter.
moira,what are those?
charles,those are all the humans of the world. and these... ... are all the mutants. im connected to all of their minds.
moira,the cia would kill for this.
charles,"i know they would. where are you, erik?"
erik,charles?
charles,"hello, old friend. im sorry. i am so sorry. i feel your pain. and your loss."
erik,"you think, because you can see into my head... ... you know how it feels? you are looking in the wrong place, charles."
charles,"what happened to them, it was terribly wrong. but, come back to us. i can help you."
erik,help me?
charles,"think of your wife, think of your daughter. - what would they have wanted?"
erik,"they would have wanted to live. i tried your way, charles. i tried to be like them. live like them. but it always ends the same way. they took everything away from me. now... well take everything from them."
charles,hank. hes not alone.
apocalypse,extraordinary.
warren,what do you see?
apocalypse,the answer.
charles,oh my god.
apocalypse,thank you for letting me in.
hank,"charles. charles, get out! charles? charles i have never felt power like this before."
hank,"charles. charles, get out!"
raven,whats going on? whats happening?
hank,i think... someones taken over cerebro. - theyve taken control of it.
raven,to do what?
hank,to connect.
apocalypse,its always the same. and now all this. no more stones. not more spears. no more slings. no more swords. no more weapons! no more systems! no more! no more superpowers.

apocalypse,"all will be revealed, my child."
alex,stop!
