Charles,"Mutants, born with extraordinary abilities, and yet still, they are children, stumbling in the dark, searching for guidance. A gift can often be a curse. Give someone wings, and they may fly too close to the sun. Give them the power of prophecy, and they may live in fear of the future. Give them the greatest gift of all, powers beyond imagination, and they may think they are meant to rule the world."
Death,"Soon, you will rule forever, My Lord."
Egyptian Guard,DEATH TO THE FALSE GOD!
Horsemen of Apocalypse,Watch over him!
Teacher,"As everyone knows, the existence of mutants was first discovered during the Paris Peace Accords after the Vietnam war in 1973. 6 days later, we all watched as one of those mutants... Erik Lehnsherr, attacked the president and the cabinet on the lawn of the White House. Their lives were saved by a young mutant, who stopped him. Now, Lehnsherr escaped and became the worlds most wanted fugitive. And as for her, she disappeared as well. But, she has become the symbol of a new age. The face of a world that will never be the same again."
Dude,You winking at my girl?
Teacher,"Yes, the world is panicked."
Scott,Your girl.
Teacher,... and there is still some prejudice.
Scott,I guess you do look old enough
Teacher,"But today,"
Scott,to be her father.
Teacher,"mutants are found in all walks of life. Excuse me, gentlemen, is there something that you would like to be sharing with the rest of the class?"
Scott,Can I please go to the bathroom. I think theres something seriously wrong with my eyes.
Teacher,"Fine, Scott, and afterward, why dont you stop by the principals office and explain to him that youre disrupting the class again. I trust you know the way."
Scott,"Yeah, I do."
Teacher,"Okay. (Bell rings) Oh. Hang on. Hang on. Now, I know most of you were what? Around 7 years old at that time."
Dude,Summers! I know youre in here. Are you crying? I havent even kick your ass yet. Summers. You want to eyeball my girl? Summers. Summers.

Worker,"Have a good night, Henryk."
Erik,"Same to you, Milosz. Hi, my love."
Magda,Hi. Good day?
Erik,Better now. - Wheres Nina?
Magda,At the back. With her friends.
Nina,"Where did you learn that song, Papa?"
Erik,"I learned it from my parents. And they learned it from their parents. And them from theirs. And one day, you will sing it to you children too."
Nina,"What happened to them, your parents?"
EriK,"They were taken from me, when I was a little boy. But, they are still here, inside. And here... with you."
Nina,Is someone going to take you away?
Erik,Never.
Alex,I guess were more alike than we thought.
Woman,He wont listen to us. He just... Hes been...
Alex,Scott. Let me try. XAVIERS SCHOOL FOR GIFTED YOUNGSTERS
Scott,Smells pretty old in here. Is this a school or museum.
Alex,"One more, and last one. Oh."
Jean,(through telepathy) Watch where youre going.
Scott,I cant...
Alex,What? Who are you talking to?
Jean,Me.
Scott,I just heard you in my head.
Jean,"Im telepathic, I read minds."
Scott,"Well, stay out of mine. I dont need some weird girl creeping around in there."
Jean,"Dont worry, Scott, theres not much to see."
Scott,"Hey, wait. I didnt tell you my name."
Jean,"No, you didnt."
Hank,Alex Summers?
Alex,Hank McCoy! Whoa. What happen to the big blue... furry you?
Hank,"I, keep it under control now."
Alex,"This is my brother, Scott."
Hank,"Hey, Scott. Im Hank McCoy. Im one of the teachers here. (Scott nods a little)"
Alex,Wheres the Professor?
Charles,"... to break forth bloodily, then the past must be obliterated and a new start made. Let us now start fresh without remembrance, rather than live forward and backward at the same time. Now, what are the aggrieve things that the author meant when he wrote all that? He... Thats going to be your assignment for tomorrow. Top marks, everyone. Class dismiss. Alex, its good to see you."
Alex,"Yeah, you too."
Charles,You look... well. Its been a while.
Alex,It has. Youre not too bad yourself.
Charles,Thank you.
Alex,"This is my brother, Scott."
Charles,"Hello, Scott. Welcome to the school for the gifted."
Scott,Yeah. It doesnt exactly feel like a gift.
Charles,"It never does, not at first. The first step in understanding ones power is learning the extent of it. Only then, can we begin the process of teaching you how to control it. If you do decide to stay, I can promise you that by the time you are done here youll be able to go back into the world and play a stable productive partner. Why dont you take your bandages off and we can have a look at what were dealing with here. Alex, would you line him up. Face him in the right direction if you will. Theres a target just across the water. When you open your eyes, try and hit that. You can open your eyes, Scott. Theres nothing to be afraid of. Its quite... Get back! Get back. Get back. Whoa! My grandfather planted that tree when he was 5 years old. I used to swing from the branches then myself. I think that was probably my favourite tree."
Scott,Does that mean Im expelled?
Charles,On the contrary. Youre enrolled.
Moira,Do you sell carpets?
Some Dude,You cannot come in here.
Moira,The carpet is for sale?
Some Dude,I said...
Worker,Earthquake!
Charles,"Back to bed, please, my darling. - Back to bed. -"
Hank,Shes doing it again.
Charles,"Back to bed, please, everyone. Jessie, back to bed, please. Come on, now. Spitzbolt, back to bed. Carrie Anne, come on, now. Back to bed. - Ive never seen her like this. -"
Hank,"Well, I do."
Charles,Dont let any of the children come this way. Jean. Jean! JEAN !!! I...
Jean,I saw the end of the world. I could feel all this death.
Charles,Nope. It was just a dream. -
Jean,"But, it felt real. -"
Charles,I know. Your mind is the most powerful Ive ever seen. - It can convince itself... -
Jean,"No, its not just a mind reading or a telekinesis, its something else. Some... dark power inside and its growing, like a fire. - I thought I was getting better. -"
Charles,You are. You will. - You just have to be patient. -
Jean,No. No. You dont know what its like to be afraid to shut your eyes. - To be trapped inside your own head. -
Charles,"Oh, but I think I do. It wasnt so long ago, that I was plagued by voices of myself. All their suffering. All their pain. Their secrets."
Jean,Im afraid one day I am going to hurt someone.
Charles,"Lie back. Everyone fears that which they do not understand. You will learn to control your powers. And when you do, youll have nothing to fear."
Charles,Her nightmares were different this time.
Hank,"Well, it could have count for something I saw while I was in my lab earlier. There was some kind of tremor. Like an energy surge. - I picked it up on one of my meters. -"
Charles,Youre saying that Jean created it.
Hank,"No, Im saying something else did. Maybe she was reacting to it, I dont know. But, the Epicenter was half way around the world."
Charles,Half way around the world?
Hank,Yeah. Thats why I was hoping you could take a look.
Charles,Lets see what we can find.
Computer,Welcome Professor.
Hank,The source came from Cairo. Ill put in the coordinates.
Moira,I got to get out of here and give them a report.
Hank,What? What is it?
Moira,"Something happened here, I can tell its real."
Charles,Its her.
Hank,Who?
Charles,Moira.
Hank,What? - Moira MacTaggert?
Charles,Mm-hm.
Hank,And give me the details?
Charles,"Well, she looks amazing. - Shes barely aged a day."
Hank,No. I meant... What is she doing there? Whats the CIA doing with this?
Charles,"Shes going back to Langley to deliver a report. Im going to go there, see if she knows something about the tremor."
Hank,Youll wind up seeing Moira.
Charles,"I want to go check her out, check out... the situation. Moira MacTaggert. Its like a ghost from the past."
Magda,"You did a good thing, you saved that man."
Erik,"Thats not the point. If Im exposed, were all exposed. We have to go."
Magda,This is our home. This is our daughters home.
Erik,"We are her home. I told you who I was, the first night I met you. I trusted you then. I need you to trust me now. We cant stay here anymore."
Magda,Ill get Nina.  Sweetheart? Shes not in her room. And I dont see her at the back.
Both,Nina! - Nina! - Nina! - Nina! Nina!
Erik,Nina. Are you okay?
Police Officer,She is fine.
Erik,"Then, let her go."
Police Officer,We will. We just wanted to talk.
Erik,You are not wearing your badges. No metal.
Police Officer,"Some men from the factory said they saw something today. Something that made no sense. Keep your weapons. You have been a good citizen, Henryk. A good neighbor, good worker. - I believe you are."
Magda,He is.
Police Officer,But nobody in town really knows who you are.
Erik,"Everyone knows. Im Henryk Gurzsky. Jacob, I even had dinner at his house."
Jacob,And you lied all the time. I let a murderer in my house Is that you? Are you the one called Magneto?
Erik,I surrender. Please. Let my daughter go. Go with your mother.
Nina,Please! Dont leave me. - Im not going to let them take you.
Magda,Nina. Nina. Nina. Nina.
Nina,Please!
Police Officer,Whats happening? She is one of them.
Nina,Please.
Police Officer,Make her stop.
Erik,She cant control them.
Magda,Nina.
Nina,Please.
Erik,Shes frightened.
Nina,Im not letting them take you! Im not letting them take you!
Police Officer,Make it stop!
Magda,Nina.
Erik,"No. No, Nina! . Nina? Nina. No. Dont... Please. Please. Please. What have you done? Not my babies. Not my babies. IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT FROM ME? Is this what I am? Is this what I am"
Merchant,You know what we do with thieves? Choose a hand.
Apocalypse,Enough.
Merchant,"If you are with her, I suggest you go away. Go away."
Apocalypse,Who rules this world?
Merchant,What language is that? Clown! What do you want? Go away! Sorry. Sorry.
Apocalypse,"You feel it, dont you? Now, you feel it. CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY UNITED STATES OF AMERICA"
Alex,"So, you really havent seen her in all these years? You never looked her up? Not even in Cerebro?"
Charles,"Alex. Who do you take me for? Some kind of pervert? I... Yes, I looked her up once. Twice. But, not in a long time."
Alex,Alright? Howd you leave things? - Any hard feelings?
Charles,"Not likely. Everybody take a break. I wiped her mind off all memories of us. The beach, Cuba, that whole time. Its so long ago, Alex. Before the world knew about mutants, I have felt... it was the best thing for her."
Alex,And for you?
Charles,It didnt really matter whats best for me. Moira MacTaggert.  Hello.  Allow me to introduce myself. Im Professor...
Moira,Charles Xavier - I know exactly who you are.
Charles,You do?
Moira,Of course I do. Ive read all of your papers. Its a pleasure to finally meet you.  - Moira MacTaggert.
Alex,Alex Summers.
Moira,"Have a seat. Just, throw that on the floor."
Charles,Its wonderful to see you again. To-To meet you again for the first time. I... You got a son? - Yes. - Does he have a husband or... Do you have a husband?
Moira,"I had a husband, but... Its hard to do this job and make it home in time for dinner."
Charles,"Good. Good. We all make choices, right?"
Moira,"Yes, we do. - Professor. - Yes?"
Charles,Yes. I was... we were hoping that you would tell us about what happened yesterday in Egypt.
Moira,"Im afraid thats classified information. And, I dont mean to be rude, but... How did you get in here?"
Charles,I have level 5 clearance.
Moira,"Ever since the world found out about mutants in 73, there have been cults who see them as some kind of second coming or sign of god. I was tracking one of them. They called themselves, Ashir En Sabah Nur, named after an ancient being they believed to be the worlds first."
Alex,The world firsts what?
Moira,The worlds first mutant.
Alex,I thought mutants didnt evolve until this century.
Moira,"Thats the common theory, yes. But, these guys believe that the first mutant was born tens of thousands of years ago. And they believe he will rise again. Theyve been searching ancient sites all round the world for clues. These hieroglyphs described a specific set of powers greater than any man can possess."
Alex,They think he lived all that time?
Moira,"Yes and no. They believe he had the ability to transfer his consciousness from body to body, and whenever he was close to death he would just take on a new body. So, these may have been the bodies of mutants enabling him to take their powers amassing varies abilities over the years."
Charles,An all powerful mutant.
Moira,"Exactly. And wherever this being was, he always had 4 principle followers. Disciples. Protectors he would imbue their powers."
Alex,Like the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. - He got that one from the Bible.
Moira,"Or the Bible got it from him. And wherever he ruled, eventually, it would end in disaster. Cataclysm. Some kind of... Apocalypse."
Charles,The end of the world.
Star Trek Character,"I must say, Apollo. The way you ape human behavior is remarkable."
Storm,"Get out. Come one. Come on. Come on. Ive never seen another mutant in this city. Do you speak Egyptian? Arab? English? Great fighter. Shes my hero. I want to be like her. Theres some food here, not much."
TV," I dont believe it. You love me. Love you? Be logical. Im not some simple shepherdess you can awe. Why, I could no more love you than I could love a new species of... Bacteria."
Storm,What are you doing?
Apocalypse,Learning.
Reporter,"In the streets there is outrage against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan... The brotherhood of our kind. One of them was held in Boston. Since the act in the nuclear weapons, the United States does not start fights..."
Apocalypse,Weapons?
Reporter,Never before has man possess so much power. With Soviet Union and the United States being superpowers...
Apocalypse,"Superpowers? The weak have taken the Earth. For this, I was betrayed. False gods. Idols. No more. I have returned. The new tomorrow, that starts today."
Storm,Where did you come from?
Apocalypse,The time before man lost his way.
Storm,Well. Welcome to the 80s.
Apocalypse,This world needs to be... Purged.
Storm,What?
Apocalypse,Saved.
Storm,"You cant save the world, just going around killing people. Theres laws, system and place for that kind of thing."
Storm,"My child, why do you enslave yourself?"
Storm,What are you doing?
Storm,Making you stronger. My goddess.
Storm,Yes. You were right. The time has passed. There is no room for gods.
Kurt,Why cant I go with you.
Raven,"I told you, I work alone. Wait there."
Caliban,"Always good to see your face, even if its not yours. Papers and passage for me. Where is the gentleman going, may I ask?"
Raven,"Dont matter, dont care. I just saved his life, what he does with it is up to him."
Caliban,"Mystique, the mercenary."
Raven,Dont call me that.
Caliban,"No matter how much you pretend to be someone else, Caliban knows who you are. If theres anything worth knowing about mutants, Caliban knows it."
Psylocke,Mystique.
Raven,Why dont you ask your psychics what will happen if you keep pushing me.
Caliban,"What will happen? Psylocke gets a little jealous. - Cause Caliban likes you. - Caliban likes money. Caliban likes you so much, he wants to give you free information. About an old friend. From back when you have friends. Do you remember, Erik Lehnsherr? My girls had a flash of him in Poland. He left quite a few dead bodies in his wake, including his wife and daughter. Should be on the news soon enough. But... Caliban gives you a little head start."
Raven,How fast are you?
Kurt,How fast?
Raven,How far can you cover?
Kurt,"Uh, as far as I can see, - or if Ive been there before."
Raven,Come with me Crawler.
Kurt,"Actually its Nightcrawler, and my real name is... ... Kurt Wagner."
Hank,"The lenses are made up of some ruby quartz I have lying around. They should be able to refract your optic beams and keep them contain within their own vector fields. Try them on. Okay, go ahead. Wait. Wait. Sorry, no. Okay."
Scott,Now?
Hank,"Yeah, youre good."
Scott,"Alright. Whoa. I can see. Thank you. Professor, thank you. Youre a genius."
Hank,"No, Im... not a professor. I wish."
Scott,Whos that?
Hank,"I believe you two have met, thats Jean Grey. You bumped into her when you arrived."
Scott,"Wait, thats her?"
Hank,Yeah.
Scott,Hey.
Jean,You can see.
Scott,Yeah. Its not as bad as I thought here.
Student 1,Freak.
Student 2,Someone should warn that new kid.
Scott,"Theyre still scared of me. Hey, I have special glasses now!"
Jean,"Theyre not scared of you, theyre scared of me. Youre not the only one who cant fully control your powers."
Scott,"Wait, so... Last night, when the house shook... That was you?"
Jean,"Sorry to break it to you, but you are not the biggest freak of this school."
Scott,Well. Thats a first.
Hank,Raven. Wow. Uh. - I... Youre...
Raven,Not blue? Its like you and I have that in common now.
Hank,"No. No, I meant... Youre... Youre back. I never thought I would see you here again."
Raven,"Yeah, me neither."
Kurt,Im blue. Im Kurt.
Raven,"Oh, right."
Kurt,Kurt Wagner.
Hank,Welcome.
Caliban,Were closed. I knew I felt a chill in the air. How did you get in here?
Storm,We let ourselves in.
Apocalypse,"We are looking for mutants. Since you know where to find them, we came here."
Caliban,Caliban doesnt know you.
Apocalypse,We are looking for the strongest.
Psylocke,Everything alright?
Caliban,"Im fine, Psylocke. How much money do you have?"
Apocalypse,None.
Caliban,"Like Caliban said... We are closed, yeah?"
Apocalypse,"I need your help, my child."
Caliban,You dont look Calibans father. Maybe a little bit up here.
Apocalypse,"You are all my children. And you are lost, because you follow blind leaders. These false gods. Systems of the weak. They ruined my world... ... no more."
Psylocke,What do you want?
Apocalypse,I want you... To feel the full reach of your power. Youve only have a taste of your true strength. Unlike others who seek to control you. I want to set you free.
Psylocke,I know the kind of mutants you are looking for. And I know where to find them.
Kurt,Its my first time in America. I am very excited to see your culture.
Jubilee,"Well, you are not going to see it here. The only thing American about this place is that it used to be British. This is Scott. He is new here too."
Scott,And Im already up for a prison break. What do you say we take this blue guy on a little field trip? Im sure theres a mall around here somewhere.
Kurt,Whats a mall?
Scott,Whats a mall? Alright. Now its a matter of national pride. - Civic duty.
Jean,Scott.
Scott,What? Youve been cooped up here for a long time. And the Professor is not even home.
Kurt,I-I like to go to the mall.
Scott,Try it. - Alright. Where does he keep his cars?
Warren,"Faire pisse. Or should I say, ""Piss off""?"
Storm,This is the guy?
Psylocke,He used to be. I didnt know his wings were... Lets get out of here. His fighting days are done.
Apocalypse,"No, theyre not."
Warren,What the hell is this?
Apocalypse,I want to give you something.
Warren,There is nothing you can give me that I want.
Apocalypse,"Yes, there is. Yes, my son. Yes. Rise, my angel. Rise."
Hank,"Hypersonic, blast resistance, stealth technology."
Raven,Thats impressive. How are you ever gonna get it out of here?
Hank,"Well, thats okay. I built a retractable roof into the basketball court."
Raven,"Hank, youre building a warplane down here."
Hank,"After what happened in Washington, I thought we would come back to start the X-Men. Like we always talked about, but... Charles wants students not soldiers. He thinks the best of people. He has hope."
Raven,And you?
Hank,"You know, I think we should hope for the best. And prepare for the worst. I think the world needs the X-Men. Maybe, now that youre back you can help me convince him - ... we can start it together."
Raven,"Hank, Im here about Erik."
Hank," Right. Erik. Yeah, of course. Of course."
Raven,I think he might be in some kind of trouble. Real trouble.
Hank,Isnt he always?
Erik,Some of you spoke to the police... About what your believed you witnessed here yesterday. You want to know my past? Know who I am? See what I can do? Ill show you. Think about the person you love most in your life. Your wife. Mother. Daughter. Now that person will know what it is to lose someone they love. And live with that pain. - Forever.
Worker,"Henryk, please. Dont do this."
Erik,"My name isnt Henryk. My name is Magneto. Who the fuck are you? Stay back. Whoever you are, dont try to stop me from killing these men."
Apocalypse,Im not here for them. Im here for you. Come and see. This is where your power was born. And this is where your people were slaughtered.
Erik,You shouldnt have brought me here.
Apocalypse,"Why? Are you afraid to be here? You cant escape it, Erik."
Erik,Who are you?
Apocalypse,"Elohim, Shen, Ra. Ive been called many names over many lifetimes. I am born of death. I was there to spark and fan the flame of mans awakening, to spin the wheel of civilization. And when the forest would grow rank and in need of clearing for new growth... I was there to set it ablaze."
Erik,Where were you? When my father and mother were slaughtered in this place?
Apocalypse,"Asleep. Trapped in darkness. I was not there for you, my son. But I am here now. You dont know your own strength, but I do. Reach down. Feel the metal in the ground. Reach, as deep as you can. Youll find you have the power to move the very Earth itself. Everything theyve built will fall! And from the ashes of their world, well build a better one!"
Reporter,"Lehnsherr was identified yesterday in this small town, in central Poland. Leaders from all communities are urging their citizens to remain calm as police and armed forces are mobilizing to find Lehnsherr before he can strike again. If anyone has information about Lehnsherr, or as he is also known as Magneto. Contact you local authorities immediately. And proceed with caution. - As he is considered extremely dangerous."
Peters Mom,Peter.
Peter,Whats up?
Peters Mom,Im just checking on you.
Peter,"Im good, playing Pac-Man."
Peters Mom,Are you sure you werent watching this?
Reporter,The world was celebrating 10 years of peace between mutants and mankind.
Peters Mom,"Youre going after him, arent you?"
Peter,"You wanted me to get out of the house more, right?"
Peters Mom,I cant stop you.
Peter,Nobody can.
Peters Mom,Trust me. This wont end well. Nothing does with him.
Peter,Im not afraid of him.
Peters Mom,You should be. XAVIERS SCHOOL FOR GIFTED YOUNGSTERS
Moira,"Ive read so much about this place. But being here, it actually seems kind of... ... familiar."
Charles,Its strange. - It could be quite. Shall we? NOW PLAYING THE RETURN OF THE JEDI
Jubilee,"Im just saying, ""The Empire"" is still the best. Its the most complex, the most sophisticated, wasnt afraid to have a dark ending."
Scott,"Yeah, but come on. If it wasnt for the first one you wouldnt have any of the rest of the movies."
Jean,"Well, at least we can all agree the third one is always the worst."
Charles,Hank. You in here? Id like you to meet the...
Raven,Moira.
Charles,Raven?
Moira,"Im sorry, have we met?"
Charles,"Hank, Alex, agent MacTaggert, would you give us just one moment please?"
Moira,Of course.
Raven,"Charles, why didnt she recognize me? She knew me in this form."
Charles,"Well. After you left me on the beach in Cuba, I took her memories of that time. Have a sit."
Raven,Lucky girl.
Charles,"Its good to see you, Raven. - Welcome home."
Raven,This isnt my house.
Charles,It was once.
Raven,"No, it was your home. I just lived here. I barely even recognize it now."
Charles,"Yeah, I have plans for this place. I mean to turn it into a real campus. A university. Not just for mutants, even for humans too. Living and working, ... growing together."
Raven,"You know, I really believed that once. I really believed we can change them after DC."
Charles,We did.
Raven,No Charles. They still hate and fear us. Its just harder to see because theyre more polite about it. I got sick of living that lie.
Charles,Thats why youre not in your natural blue form.
Raven,Im not going to be the face of a world that doesnt exist.
Charles,Things are better. The world is better.
Raven,"Maybe in Westchester. Out there, mutants are still running, hiding, living in fear. Just because theres not a war doesnt mean theres peace. If you want to teach your kids something, teach them that. Teach them to fight. Otherwise, they might as well live in this house for the rest of their lives."
Charles,You still sound just like him. You sound just like Erik.
Raven,Thats why Im here. Hes resurfaced. He had a wife and a daughter. They were killed. Along with a handful of policemen. The whole world will be looking for him. But you can help me find him before they do.
Charles,"Moira, Im going to have to ask you to keep this a secret."
Moira,I dont even know what this... is.
Raven,Its Cerebro. - The new model.
Hank,Yeah. I based the color on... It doesnt matter.
Moira,What are those?
Charles,Those are all the humans of the world. And these... ... are all the mutants. Im connected to all of their minds.
Moira,The CIA would kill for this.
Charles,"I know they would. Where are you, Erik?"
Erik,Charles?
Charles,"Hello, old friend. Im sorry. I am so sorry. I feel your pain. And your loss."
Erik,"You think, because you can see into my head... ... you know how it feels? You are looking in the wrong place, Charles."
Charles,"What happened to them, it was terribly wrong. But, come back to us. I can help you."
Erik,Help me?
Charles,"Think of your wife, think of your daughter. - What would they have wanted?"
Erik,"They would have wanted to live. I tried your way, Charles. I tried to be like them. Live like them. But it always ends the same way. They took everything away from me. Now... Well take everything from them."
Charles,Hank. Hes not alone.
Apocalypse,Extraordinary.
Warren,What do you see?
Apocalypse,The answer.
Charles,Oh my god.
Apocalypse,Thank you for letting me in.
Hank,"Charles. Charles, get out! Charles? Charles I have never felt power like this before."
Hank,"Charles. Charles, get out!"
Raven,Whats going on? Whats happening?
Hank,I think... Someones taken over Cerebro. - Theyve taken control of it.
Raven,To do what?
Hank,To connect.
Apocalypse,Its always the same. And now all this. No more stones. Not more spears. No more slings. No more swords. No more weapons! No more systems! No more! No more superpowers.
Hank,Charles!
Raven,Hank!
Government Official,What the hell is going on? Whos turning the keys?
Director,The men are.
Government Official,Who agreed with the launch?
Raven,"Hank, do something!"
Hank,It wont shut down!
Government Official,Weve lost contact with the Trident and Polaris subs. The Air Force is reporting the same thing.
Apocalypse,They put so much faith in their... tools and their... machines.
Government Official,"Russia, China, England, Israel, India. Everybodys got nukes in the air."
Black Official,Whats the target? Where are they going?
Director,Up. Straight up.
Charles,Alex.
Alex,What?
Charles,Destroy it! Destroy everything! Destroy Cerebro! Wreak havoc.
Apocalypse,You can fire your arrows from the Tower of Babel. BUT YOU CAN NEVER STRIKE GOD!
Moira,"Charles. Charles, are you okay?"
Raven,Erik. Charles!
Hank,Alex!
Alex,"Hey! Hey, asshole!"
Apocalypse,"All will be revealed, my child."
Alex,Stop!
Hank,NO!
Peter,Wow!
Hank,Where... Where did you...?
Peter,I was looking for the Professor. I thought he lived here.
Hank,They took him away.
Student 3,Shes the one.
Student 4,Thats her.
Student 5,Are you sure?
Student 6,Is she going to help us?
Hank,They look up to you. Right now. They need you.
Raven,Thats not what they need.
Student 7,Whoa! Thats far out.
Scott,What happened? Wheres Alex? Wheres my brother?
Alex,Im pretty sure I got everybody.
Hank,Alex was closest to the blast.
Scott,Alex.
Solider,"Were 1 click out. Alright, boys. This is it."

Moira,"Hey! Moira MacTaggert, CIA! Thank God youre here!"
Raven,WAIT !
William,Fire! I want her! Him! Him! - And her!
Solider,"Yes, sir."
William,Leave the kids.
Kurt,What do we do? -
Jean,Keep quiet.
Solider,"X-Ray 7, Im doing a final sweep on the ground. Alright, you! Are you clear? Clear!"
Solider," Pack them up. Lets go. Come on, lets move!"
Scott," Thanks, Jean. We got to help them. - Kurt, can you get us in that thing?"
Kurt, - You want to get in there? What if the soldiers see us?
Jean," Dont worry. They wont see us, trust me."
Kurt, Hold on.
Scott," Kurt, get us all out of here! I cant! When they closed the doors, theres some kind of electric field. - Its like Berlin all over. Scott: - Jean, get into the pilots heads. - Dont let them take off! Jean: - I cant. I cant reach the pilots. I cant reach anyone. News reporter: Were also getting reports from Europe and Asia. This was not just the US phenomenon. It seems the entire world has been disarmed of nuclear weapons. The Pentagon has confirmed multiple launches from Russia, as well as the UK, Israel and China. Student 8: - Look! - Up there. News reporter: So far, there has been no response from the White House. Eye witness accounts have been pouring in from across the globe. Authorities are not sure if it was an act of peace or an act of war. Kurt: Dear Father. Hold me in the light of God. Scott: It should have been me. He was the one whos going to do something with his life. He was always the one. Jean: Thats not how he felt. He felt you were the one whos going to do something special with your life. That youre going to make a difference in the world. Maybe even change it. Scott: How did you know what he felt? I know what everybody feels. Kurt: Hold me in the light of God. Protect me from danger. Save me by your command. Listen to my prayer. And keep me safe."
Charles," Youre blocking me. How? Apocalypse: I can shield their minds from your power. Its one of the many gifts I have acquired through out the millennia. But to... see... inside a mind. To control it. Thats your gift. You saw it, didnt you? The glory of whats to come. Charles: Are you going to take part in all this killing? Destruction?"
Erik," - Its all I ever known. Charles - No, it isnt. - Youve just forgotten."
Erik," - No, Charles, I remember. Your way doesnt work. Apocalypse: I showed him a better way. A better world."
Charles," No, you just tapped into his rage and pain. Thats all youve done. I told you from the moment I met you, theres more to you, Erik. There is good in you too. Erik: Whatever it is you think you saw in me, Charles. I buried it. With my family."
Peter, - What? - What? Whats wrong with you? Is that going to happen to all of us?
Hank," No, I just left my meds in the house."
Moira,"- What happened? Where we are? Raven: - Hey. Hey! William: - Hello, Mystique. Raven: - Major Stryker. William: Colonel Stryker. I wouldnt get too close to the wall if I were you. It may create some... discomfort."
Moira," Im Moira MacTaggert. Im a senior officer at the CIA. William: I know who you are, agent MacTaggert. Moira: - You cannot keep me here in this..."
William," - Actually, I can. A psychic event just destroyed every nuke from here to Moscow. That event emanated from exactly where we found you. At the home of the worlds most powerful psychic. So, youre going to tell me. Where is Charles Xavier? Moira: Its not him you should be worried about. Theres someone else. Someone more powerful. Raven: If you let us out of here, we can help you. William: Do you really expect me to believe that? You can put on any face that you want, but I know who you are. What you are. Hank: Hey, Moira. Mm. What did you mean when you said someone more powerful than Charles?"
Soldier 10," Once he finished this, well go from there. Scott: Whats taking so long? Kurt: I cant get in. It has a field around it like the helicopter. Scott: Theres got to be a way to cut the power. Apocalypse: Charles, you will send a message to every living mind. You will tell them that this Earth will be laid waste. That it is I, En Sabah Nur, who wreak this upon them. Now. Deliver my message. Charles: Even if I wanted to, I couldnt reach that many people. I dont have Cerebro. Apocalypse: You dont need a machine... to amplify your powers. You have me. Scott: Guys, that could be our way out of here. Peter: You know him? Magneto. Raven: I used to. Im not so sure anymore. Peter: What was he like? Was he... like they say he was? Was he a... ... bad guy? Raven: No. I mean, yeah. He was... Why do you care so much? Did you see his speech on TV or something? Peter: Yeah, but... Hes my father. Raven: What? Peter: - He and my mom, they... Raven: - Yeah, I know. But... Are you sure? Peter: Yeah. Yeah. yeah. He left my mom before I was born. I met him 10 years back, but I didnt know it was him. By the time I figured it out, it was too late, you know. Then, this week I saw him on TV again. And, I came to their house looking for him. But, by the time I got there... Late again. You know, for a guy who moves as fast as me, I always seem to be too late. Raven: Lets hope not this time. Peter: Yeah. Seriously. Charles: Hear me, inhabitants of this world. Scott: - What is this? Charles: - This is a message. Jean: I think its the Professor. Charles: A message to every man, woman and mutant. Apocalypse: You have lost your way. Charles: You have lost your way. Apocalypse: But I have returned. Charles: But I have returned. The day of reckoning, it is here. All your buildings... All your buildings and temples... ... will fall. The dawn of a new era will emerge. For there is nothing you can do... - Jean. - ... to stop what is coming. Jean, if you can hear me, focus on my voice. Cairo. Find us. Jean, find us. Cairo. Find us. Jean. This message is for one reason alone. Apocalypse: To tell the strongest among you... Those with the greatest power. This earth will be yours. Charles: Those with the greatest power. Protect those without. Thats my message to the world. Hank: That was Charles doing that without Cerebro."
Solider," Sir, what was that voice? William: I know that voice. Its Xavier, isnt it? Whats going on? Raven: - We dont know! Peter: - We dont know, bro! Jean: He just spoke to me. Scott: - I think he spoke to everyone. Kurt: - I can hear him too. Jean: No, no. He just sent me a hidden message. One he knew only I would hear. I know where they are."
Solider," Hey! Solider: Shots fired! Wheres it coming from? Solider: I have intruders in quad 6. William: Send a security team and take them out. Scott: The generator. Its worth a shot. Jean: Kurt? Scott: Theres some kind of animal in there. Jean: Its no animal. Its a man. Kurt: Who is he? Jean: A part of himself has been taken away. Scott: What do you mean? Jean: I mean, they turned him into... ... some kind of weapon. Solider: Charlie 3, report. Did you find them? Solider: Turn it down. Solider: Fire! Solider: Weapon X is loose. I repeat. Weapon X is loose. Scott: You sure hes not an animal? Solider:- Hes in the central halls. - Engaging target, Sector 5. We cant stop h... ! Solider: Hey! Moira: - What are they doing? Hank: - Whats going on? Solider: I just lost the feed. - Whats going on here? - Hey! William: Ill be right back. Solider: Move!"
Solider," Hey! Stay where you are! Jean: Scott, wait. I can help you. Scott: Jean. Jean: Logan. Logan. Scott: What did you do to him? Jean: I found a piece of his past and gave it back to him. Just a few memories I could reach. Scott: I hope thats the last wed seen of that guy."
Hank," Kurt. Moira: - What? Peter: - What? Kurt: Hey. Stay away from the... Hank: The what? Kurt: Th... door... Stay away from the... Raven: - Get away from the door! Peter: - The door! The door! Kurt: On three. One. Two. Jean: We know where the Professor is. Scott: I think we might have a way out of here. Raven: Well, youve been busy. Scott: We had a... a little help. Lets go. Kurt: - Watch out! Peter: - Jesus! Kurt: Oh, sorry. Scott: This way. Apocalypse: This was meant to be the center of the universe before I was betrayed. Now. It will be."
Hank,"Nice. Raven: Hey, Hank. Do you think you can fly this thing? Hank: Yeah, I can figure it out Scott:. Hey, guys. Flight suits. Raven: You got your warplane. Lets go to war. Apocalypse: A gift... From the past you left behind. And the future that lies ahead. You, will reach down, my son, deep into the Earth. Rip everything they built from the ground. Wipe clean this world. And we will lead those that survived. Into to a better one. Charles: And me? Am I to play a role in this madness? Apocalypse: You have the most important role of all. Jean: Were you scared? That day in DC, were you scared? Raven: No. But I was scared on my first mission. I was on a plane like this with my friends. About your age. We called ourselves the X-Men. Your brother was there. We used to call Havoc. He was a real handful, but... When it came down to it, he was very brave. Kurt: What happened to the rest of the kids that went with you? The X-Men. Hank: Hank and I are the only ones left. I couldnt save the rest of them. I told you, Im not a hero. Jean: Well, youre a hero to us. Seeing you that day on TV changed my life. Kurt: My too. Peter: My too. I mean, I still live in my moms basement, but... Everything else is... Well, its pretty much the same. Im a total loser. Scientist: What were seeing is a magnetic phenomenon on a much larger scale than we saw in Auschwitz. The ground is full of magnetic elements. Iron, nickel, cobalt. The oceans floor is lying with them too. Its already begun, at the lowest depths. Land masses will slow it, but not for long. Eventually, cities, urban centers. Anything built since the Bronze Age will be wiped away. The death toll will be billions. General: Hes talking about the whole god damn world. Charles: Youre just another false god. And whoevers left to follow you when this is all over. They will betray you again. Apocalypse: Youre wrong, Charles. For the first time in a thousand lifetimes... I have you. For all my gifts, Ive yet to possess the one I needed most. To be... everywhere. To be... everyone. Hank: Seventh wonder, 12 oclock. Jean: He has the Professor in the center of the pyramid. Hes going to transfer his consciousness into the Professor. If he does that, hell have the power to control every mind in the world. Moira:What the hell is that? Raven: Its Erik. You guys help Nightcrawler get into the pyramid. Get Charles. Ill take care of Erik. Hank: How are you going to get through that? Peter: I can get you in there. I came here for him. Let me help you. Raven: The rest of you, get Charles on this plane and get him out of here."
Nightcrawler," - Were not leaving without you! Peter: - Dont worry. Well catch up. Raven: Hold on. Raven: Hank, you go with the kids. - Moira will be waiting on the plane. Scott: - Wait. Raven: What? Scott: Not all of us can fully control our powers. Raven: Then, dont. You need to embrace them. We all do. Apocalypse: Go, join the others. Protect me until the transference is complete. Hank: Theres an entrance. Its clear. Kurt. Get in there! Hank: In the pyramid. Move! Go! Psylocke: Split them up. Jean: Professor. Kurt, you have to hurry! Kurt: Im trying. Its like a maze in here. Jean: Kurt, no! Peter: The magnetic field is too strong, I cant get us in there. Raven: Erik! Erik: Mystique. Raven: I know you think youve lost everything. But, you havent. You have me. You have Charles. You have more family than you know. You never had the chance to save your family before. But you do now. Thats what Ive come here to tell you. Erik: And you? Peter: Im your... Im here for my family too. Charles: Get out! Get out! GET OUT !!! Kurt: Arrivederci. Jean: Were losing him. Kurt: Ill be right back. Scott, glasses on! Hank: Lets go! Hank: - Lock on. Moira: - Here we go. Angel: Psylocke! Moira: What the hell was that? Jean: Kurt. Everyone grab hold of Nightcrawler! Kurt: Ive never done it with this many people. Jean: Get us out of here. Kurt, hurry! Kurt! Raven: Charles. Scott: Is he okay? Jean: Its his energy. Hes drained. Charles: No. Get out. Get... Get out!"
Jean,"Professor. Professor, its okay. Youre with us. Its okay. Raven: Im going to go fight for what I have left. Are you?"
Charles,"(During a flashback Erik has) Theres so much more than you than you know. Not just pain and anger. Theres good too. I felt it. Its not just me youre walking away from. Here you have the chance to be part of something much bigger than yourself. And it needs you, Erik."
Apocalypse, Useless. Apocalypse: Charles. I know you can hear me. Were still connected. Charles! Show yourself! CHARLES! SHOW YOURSELF! Apocalypse: Foolish child.
Charles,"Peter. Apocalypse: End him. Charles: Raven. Apocayplse: The great hero. Hank: - Im going out there. Scott: - Im going with you. Charles: No. - Its me he wants. Moria: - Charles, you cant give yourself up. If he has you, he has us all. The whole world. Apocalypse: You are feeble. Just like the others. Charles! Come! Rescue your weakling! Give your life, for theirs! Charles: No. He was right. There is still some part of me connected to him."
Apocalypse, Charles! Charles: I can get inside his head. Apocalypse: Will you do nothing? Charles: Thank you for letting me in. You want what I have? You want to feel what I feel? Welcome to my world! Youre in my house now! Apocalypse: Youll need a bigger house. You betray me? Erik: No. I betrayed them.
Hank,"Lets jump. Scott: What? Hank: Cover me. I got you. Peter: Come on! Apocalypse: They lack strength, Charles. Charles:Jean. Apocalypse: Come here. Charles: Help... Me. Hank: Stay here. Moira: They cant stop him. Charles: Jean. Help me! Scott: Hank! Hank! Apocalypse: Its over, Charles. Youre finished. Youre mine now. Charles: You will never win. Apocalypse: And why is that? Charles: Because you are alone. And I am not! Let ... go. Unleash your power, Jean. No fear. Unleash your power! Let go, Jean! Jean, let go! Hank: Hes getting away. Apocalypse: All is revealed. Moira: Charles! Charles! - Weve lost him! Hank: - Charles. Moira: - Hes gone. Hank: - No, Charles. Charles... Jean: No, hes not. I can still feel him. Charles: Thank you, Jean. Moira: Charles? Charles, do you know where you are? Charles: Im on a beach. In Cuba. With you. Moira: What beach?"
