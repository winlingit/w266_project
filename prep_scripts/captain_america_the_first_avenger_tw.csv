narrator,first lines; in the arctic
search team leader,are you the guys from washington?
shield tech,you get many other visitors out here?
shield lieutenant,how long have you been on site?
search team leader,since this morning. a russian oil team called it in about eighteen hours ago.
shield lieutenant,how come nobody spotted it before?
search team leader,its really not that surprising. this landscapes changing all the time. you got any ideas what this thing is exactly?
shield lieutenant,i dont know. its probably a weather balloon.
search team leader,i dont think so. you know we dont have the equipment for a job like this.
shield tech,how long before we can start craning it out?
search team leader,i dont think you quite understand. you guys are gonna need one hell of a crane!
narrator,as the shot widens we see a massive frozen ship revealed
narrator,after breaking into the metal aircraft & finding the frozen shield of captain america
shield tech,lieutenant! what is it?
shield lieutenant,"my god! [into his earpiece] base, give me a line to the colonel."
voice from earpiece,"its three a.m. for him, sir."
shield lieutenant,i dont care what time it is. this ones waited long enough.
narrator,1942 norway
narrator,a villager is running to a church
messenger,they have come for it!
tower keeper,they have before.
messenger,not like this.
tower keeper,let them try. they will never find it.
narrator,"rumbling is heard and something breaks down the door, the stones killing the messenger"
narrator,the tower keeper closes the messengers eyes and sees a machine moving away as hydra agents come in
narrator,a car drives up with the hydra symbol on the hood
narrator,hydra agents try to lift the lid of a coffin
johann schmidt,it has taken me a long time to find this place. you should be commended. [to one of his soldiers] pick him up.
narrator,one of the soldiers helps the tower keeper to his feet
johann schmidt,i think that you are man of great vision. and in this way we are much alike.
tower keeper,i am nothing like you.
johann schmidt,"no, of course. but what others see as superstition, you and i know to be a science."
tower keeper,what you seek is just a legend.
johann schmidt,"then why make such an effort to conceal it. [opens an old tomb and picks up the glass cube from the skeletal remains of an old viking] the tesseract was the jewel of odins treasure room. [he turns to face the tower keeper and deliberately drops and smashes the glass cube] not something one buries. but i think it is close, yes?"
tower keeper,i cannot help you.
johann schmidt,no. but maybe you can help your village. you must have some friends out there. some...some little grandchildren perhaps. i have no need for them to die.
narrator,referring to the carving of the tree on one of the tower walls
johann schmidt,"yggdrasil, the tree of the world. guardian of wisdom and fate also. [he presses a button on the carving of the tree and it opens up to reveal the real cube] and the fuhrer sends us for trinkets in the desert. you have never seen this, have you?"
tower keeper,its not for the eyes of ordinary men.
johann schmidt,exactly.
narrator,he closes the box containing the glowing cube and turns to his soldiers
tower keeper,you old fool! you cannot control the power you hold. you will burn!
johann schmidt,i already have.

4f doctor,your mother?
steve rogers,"she was a nurse in a tb ward. got hit, couldnt shake it. [the doctor looks at steves file which shows he has a long list of health issues]"
4f doctor,"sorry, son."
steve rogers,"look, just give me a chance."
4f doctor,youd be ineligible on your asthma alone.
steve rogers,is there anything you can do?
4f doctor,im doing it. im saving your life.
narrator,"later, steve is at the movie theatre"
narrator,a commercial about the war is playing before the movie
loud jerk,who cares? play the movie already.
steve rogers,"[quietly] hey, buddy, you wanna show some respect?"
narrator,the commercial continues
loud jerk,"no one cares. hey, just start the cartoon!"
steve roger,"hey buddy, you wanna shut up?!"
narrator,the guy gets up and looks at him
narrator,getting beaten in an alley by the loud jerk that was disturbing everyone at the cinema
loud jerk,"you just dont know when to give up, do you?"
steve rogers,i can do this all day. [and attacks the guy again]
james barnes,hey! pick on someone your own size.
narrator,after saving steve from getting any further beatings by the loud jerk
james barnes,"sometimes, i think you like getting punched."
steve rogers,i had him on the ropes.
narrator,picks up steves enlistment form from the ground
james barnes,how many times is this?
narrator,reading from the enlistment form
james barnes,"oh, youre from paramus now? you know its illegal to lie on the enlistment form. and seriously, jersey?"
steve rogers,did you get your orders?
james barnes,the one-o-seventh. sergeant james barnes. shipping out for england first thing tomorrow.
steve rogers,i should be going.
james barnes,"come on, man! its my last night. gotta get you cleaned up."
steve rogers,why? where are we going?
james barnes,the future.
narrator,"he hands him the newspaper he was holding, steve opens it to see the ad for world exposition"
james barnes,"i dont see what the problem is. youre about to be the last eligible man in new york. you know, theres three and a half million women here."
steve rogers,"well, id settle for just one."
james barnes,good thing i took care of that.
narrator,he waves to the dates hes lined up
steve rogers,what did you tell her about me?
james barnes,only the good stuff.
narrator,music starts playing
girl #1,its starting!
mandy,"ladies and gentlemen, mr. howard stark."
narrator,howard enters the stage and kisses the announcer
howard stark,"[addressing the audience at the world exposition fair] ladies and gentlemen, what if i told you that in just a few short years, your automobile wont even have to touch the ground at all."
narrator,the female helpers take the wheels of the car on stage
howard stark,"yes. thanks, mandy. [addressing the audience again] with stark robotic reversion technology, youll be able to do just that."
narrator,he turns on the switch of his machine and the car starts to hover off the ground
howard stark,holy cow!
narrator,the robots making the car hover suddenly malfunction and the car falls back on stage
howard stark,"i did say a few years, didnt i?"
narrator,everyone laughs
narrator,"steve disappears, and bucky notices"
narrator,"at a recruitment center, steve looks at himself as a soldier in a mirror"
james barnes,you really gonna do this again?
steve rogers,"well, its a fair. im gonna try my luck."
james barnes,"as who? steve from ohio? theyll catch you. or worse, theyll actually take you."
steve rogers,"look, i know you dont think i can do this."
james barnes,"this isnt a back alley, steve. its a war!"
steve rogers,i know its a war. you dont have to tell me.
james barnes,why are you so keen to fight? there are so many important jobs.
steve rogers,what am i gonna do? collect scrap metal...
james barnes,yes!
steve rogers,...in my little red wagon.
james barnes,why not?
steve rogers,"im not gonna sit in a factory, bucky. bucky, come on! there are men laying down their lives. i got no right to do any less than them. thats what you dont understand. this isnt about me."
james barnes,right. cause you got nothing to prove. dont do anything stupid until i get back.
steve rogers,how can i? youre taking all the stupid with you.
james barnes,youre a punk.
narrator,he walks back towards steve and hugs him goodbye
steve rogers,jerk. be careful.
narrator,as james is walking away
steve rogers,dont win the war till i get there!
james barnes,[he salutes then starts to walk away] come on girls. theyre playing our song.
narrator,steve is in a medical examination room when a nurse whispers something inaudible to young doctor
young doctor,wait here.
steve rogers,is there a problem?
young doctor,just wait here. [walks out]  [steve looks at a sign warning against lying on your enlistment form and starts to get ready to leave]  [an enlistment office mp walks in the room and steve looks up at him worriedly]  [dr. abraham erskine enters the room as enlistment office mp quietly leaves]
dr. abraham erskine,"thank you. so, you want to go overseas? kill some nazis."
steve rogers,excuse me?
dr. abraham erskine,dr. abraham erskine. [walks over and introduces himself to steve] i represent the strategic scientific reserve.
steve rogers,steve rogers.  [dr. erskine starts looking through steves file]
steve rogers,where are you from?
dr. abraham erskine,"queens. 73rd street and utopia parkway. before that, germany. this troubles you?  [steve shakes his head]"
dr. abraham erskine,[flipping through steves file] where are you from mr. rogers? mmm? is it new haven? or paramus? five exams in five different cities.
steve rogers,that might not be the right file.
dr. abraham erskine,"no, its not the exams im interested in. its the five tries. but you didnt answer my question. do you want to kill nazis?"
steve rogers,is this a test?
dr. abraham erskine,yes.
steve rogers,i dont wanna kill anyone. i dont like bullies. i dont care where theyre from.
dr. abraham erskine,"well, there are already so many big men fighting this war. maybe what we need now is the little guy, huh? i can offer you a chance."
narrator,they exit the room
dr. abraham erskine,only a chance.
steve rogers,ill take it.
dr. abraham erskine,"good. so where is the little guy from, actually?"
steve rogers,brooklyn.
dr. abraham erskine,"[dr. erskine stamps steves form and hands him back his file] congratulations, soldier."
narrator,steve opens up the file and sees that hes been stamped as accepted  [in a hydra lab in a very mountainous region]
johann schmidt,"are you ready, dr. zola?"
dr. arnim zola,my machine requires the most delicate calibration. forgive me if i seem overcautious.
johann schmidt,and are you certain that those conductors of yours can withstand the energy surge long enough for a transference.
dr. arnim zola,"with this artifact, i am certain of nothing. i fear it may not work at all."
narrator,after successfully collecting the power from the glowing tesseract using zolas machine
johann schmidt,"i must congratulate you, arnim. your designs do not disappoint. though they may require some slight reinforcement"
dr. arnim zola,"the exchange is stable. amazing! this energy where its collected could power my design, all my designs. this will change the war."
johann schmidt,"dr. zola, this will change the world."
peggy carter,"gentlemen, im agent carter. i supervise all operations of this division."
gilmore hodge,"whats with the accent, queen victoria? thought i was signing up for the u.s. army."
peggy carter,"whats your name, soldier?"
gilmore hodge,"gilmore hodge, your majesty."
peggy carter,"step forward, hodge."
narrator,hodge steps forward
peggy carter,put your right foot forward.
gilmore hodge,are we dancing? cause i got a few moves i know youll like.
narrator,suddenly peggy punches him hard in the face
narrator,col.phillips drives up
col. chester phillips,agent carter.
peggy carter,colonel phillips.
col. chester phillips,"i see youre roughening up our men, thats good. [to hodge] pick your ass out of the dirt, soldier."
gilmore hodge,"yes, sir."
narrator,hodge gets back up
col. chester phillips,[addressing the new army recruits] general patton has said that wars are fought with weapons but they are won by men. we are going to win this war because we have the best men.
narrator,he sees rogers and continues talking
col. chester phillips,"and because theyre gonna get better. much better. the strategic scientific reserve is an allied effort made up of the best minds in the free world. our goal is to create the best army in history. but every army starts with one man. [addressing the new army recruits] at the end of this week we will choose that man. he will be the first in a new breed of super-soldiers. and they, will personally escort adolf hitler to the gates of hell."
narrator,a montage of steves training goes by
narrator,then we see steve and some other trainees running up to a waiting peggy and a flagpole
col. chester phillips,"youre not really thinking about picking rogers, are you?"
dr. abraham erskine,i am more than just thinking about it. he is the clear choice.
col. chester phillips,"when you brought a ninety pounds asthmatic onto my army base, i let it slide. i thought, what the hell? maybe hell be useful to you, like a gerbil. i never thought youd pick him. [referring to steve] stick a needle in that kids arm and its gonna go right through him. [watching steve struggling whilst training with the other new recruits] look at that. hes making me cry."
dr. abraham erskine,i am looking for qualities beyond the physical.
col. chester phillips,do you know how long it took to set up this project?
dr. abraham erskine,"yeah, i know."
col. chester phillips,and all the groveling i had to do in front of senator whats his name.
dr. abraham erskine,i know. i am well aware of your efforts.
col. chester phillips,"then throw me a bone. hodge passed every test we gave him. hes big, hes fast, he obeys orders. hes a soldier."
dr. abraham erskine,hes a bully.
col. chester phillips,"you dont win wars with niceness, doctor."
narrator,he takes a hand grenade
col. chester phillips,you win war with guts.
narrator,he throws the grenade at where the new recruits are training
col. chester phillips,grenade!
narrator,all the soldiers move away quickly but steve jumps on top of it covering it with his body
steve rogers,get away! get back! [waits for the grenade to go off but nothing happens]
soldiers voice,its a dummy grenade.
narrator,steve looks at phillips and erskine
steve rogers,is this is a test?
narrator,erskine looks at phillips as to confirm his point about choosing steve
col. chester phillips,hes still skinny.
narrator,later that night
steve rogers,can i ask you a question?
dr. abraham erskine,just one?
steve rogers,why me?
dr. abraham erskine,"i suppose that is the only question that matters. [to steve] so many people forget that the first country that the nazis invaded was their own. you know, after the last war the...my people struggled. they...they felt weak. they felt small. and then hitler comes along with the marching and the big show and the flags and the...and the..."
narrator,he waves his hand
dr. abraham erskine,"and he...he hears of me, my work and he finds me. and he says, you...he says you will us strong. well, i am not interested. so he sends the head of hydra, his research division. a brilliant scientist by the name of johann schmidt. now, schmidt is a member of the inner circle and hes ambitious. he and hitler share a passion for a cult power and teutonic myth. hitler uses his fantasies to inspire his followers. but for schmidt it is not fantasy. for him, it is real. he has become convinced that there is a great power in the earth, left there by the gods, waiting to be seized by a superior man. so when he hears about my formula and what it can do, he cannot resist."
narrator,flashback of how schmidt takes erskines formula and injects himself with it
dr. abraham erskine,schmidt must become that superior man.
steve rogers,did it make him stronger?
dr. abraham erskine,"yeah. but, there were other effects. the serum was not ready. but more important, the man. the serum amplifies everything that is inside. so, good becomes great. bad becomes worse. this is why you were chosen. because a strong man, who has known power all his life, will lose respect for that power. but a weak man knows the value of strength, and knows compassion."
steve rogers,thanks. i think.
dr. abraham erskine,"whatever happens tomorrow, you must promise me one thing. that you will stay who you are. not a perfect soldier, but a good man."
narrator,steve holds up his glass to toast
steve rogers,to the little guys.
narrator,just as steves about to drink from his glass
dr. abraham erskine,no! no! wait! wait! what i am doing? no! you have a procedure tomorrow. no fluids.
narrator,he pours the contents of steves glass into his own
steve rogers,all right. well drink it after.
dr. abraham erskine,no! i dont have procedure tomorrow. drink it after? drink it now!
narrator,whilst driving through brooklyn
steve rogers,i know this neighborhood. i got beat up in that alley. and that parking lot. and behind that diner.
peggy carter,did you have something against running away?
steve rogers,"you start running theyll never let you stop. you stand up, push back. cant say no forever, right?"
peggy carter,i know a little of what thats like. to have every door shut in your face.
steve rogers,"i guess i just dont why youd wanna join the army if youre a beautiful dame. or a beautiful...a woman. an agent, not a dame! you are beautiful, but..."
peggy carter,"you have no idea how to talk to a woman, do you?"
steve rogers,this is the longers conversation ive had with one. women arent exactly lining up to dance with a guy they might step on.
peggy carter,you must have danced?
steve rogers,"well, asking a woman to dance always seems so terrifying. and the past few year just didnt seem to matter that much. figured id wait."
peggy carter,for what?
steve rogers,the right partner.
dr. abraham erskine,"[to the small group gathered to watch steve being prepared to become a super-solider] ladies and gentlemen, today we take not another step towards annihilation, but the first step on the path to peace. we begin with a series of micro injections into the subjects major muscle groups. the serum infusion will cause immediate cellular change. and then to stimulate growth, the subject will be saturated with vita rays."
steve rogers,[after preliminary injection] that wasnt so bad.
abraham erskine,that was penicillin.
narrator,knocking on the capsule that theyve locked steven in for the procedure to change him
abraham erskine,"steven, can you hear me?"
steve rogers,"its probably too late to go to the bathroom, right?"
narrator,as steve is screaming in pain as he is receiving the vita rays
abraham erskine,steven!
peggy carter,shut it down!
abraham erskine,"kill the reactor, mr. stark! kill the reactor!"
steve rogers,no! dont! i can do this!
narrator,after being transformed into a super-soldier
peggy carter,how do you feel?
steve rogers,taller.
peggy carter,you look taller. [as he captures kruger]
steve rogers,who the hell are you?
heinz kruger,"the first of many. cut off one head, two more shall take its place. hail hydra! [he pops a fake tooth loose and swallows it, he starts to foam at the mouth and then die]"
johann schmidt,"hitler speaks of a thousand year reich, but he cannot feed his army for month. his troops spill their blood across every field in europe. but he is still no closer to achieving his goals."
roeder,and i suppose you still aim to end this war through magic?
johann schmidt,"science. but i understand your confusion. great power has always baffled primitive men. hydra is assembling an arsenal to destroy my enemies in one stroke. where ever they are, regardless of how many forces they possess. all in a matter of hours."
roeder,your enemies?
johann schmidt,"my weapons contain enough destructive power to decimate every hostile capital on earth. quite simply, gentlemen, i have harnessed the power of the gods."
steve rogers,[referring to the amount of blood samples taken from him] i think you got enough.
peggy carter,any hope of reproducing a programme is locked in your genetic code. but without dr. erskine it will take years.
steve rogers,he deserved more than this.
peggy carter,"if it could only work once, hed be proud it was you. hydra is the nazi deep science division. its led by johann schmidt. but he has much bigger ambitions."
col. chester phillips,"hydras practically a cult. they worship schmidt, they think hes invincible."
senator brandt,so what are you gonna do about it?
col. chester phillips,spoke to the president this morning. as of today the ssr is being retasked.
peggy carter,colonel?
col. chester phillips,"we are taking the fight to hydra. pack your bags agent carter. you too, stark. youre flying to london tonight."
steve rogers,"sir, if youre going after schmidt, i want in."
col. chester phillips,youre an experiment. youre going to alamogordo.
steve rogers,the serum worked.
col. chester phillips,i asked for an army and all i got was you. you are not enough.
senator brandt,"son, do you wanna serve your country on the most important battle field of the war?"
steve rogers,"sir, thats all i want."
senator brandt,"then, congratulations. you just got promoted."
steve rogers,[backstage as steve is getting dressed in super-hero costume] i dont know if i can do this.
brandts aide,"nothing to it. sell off a few bonds, bonds buy bullets, bullets kills nazis. bing bang boom. youre an american hero."
steve rogers,its just now how i pictured getting there.
brandts aide,"the senators got a lot of pull up on the hill. you play ball with us, youll be leading your own platoon in no time. take the shield. [as steve puts on his head mask he pushes steve onto the stage] [addressing a crowd of soldiers in italy dressed in his super-hero costume]"
steve rogers,how many of you ready to help me sock old adolf on the jaw? [silence from the crowd of soldiers] okay. uh...i need in volunteer?
army heckler#1,i already volunteered! how do you think i got here? [the crowd of soldiers laugh] bring back the girls! [theres a cheer from the soldiers]
steve rogers,i think they only know the one song. but um...let me...ill...ill see what i can do.
army heckler#1,"you do that, sweetheart."
army heckler#2,"nice boots, tinker bell! [the crowd of soldiers laugh]"
steve rogers,"come on, guys. were all on the same team here."
army heckler#3,"hey, captain! sign this! [he stands turns and pulls his pants down]"
steve rogers,what are you doin here?
peggy carter,officially im not here at all. that was quite a performance.
steve rogers,yeah. uh...i had to improvise a little bit. crowds im used to are usually more uh...
peggy carter,but i understand you american‘s new hope?
steve rogers,bond sales take a ten percent bump in every state i visit.
peggy carter,is that senator brandt i hear?
steve rogers,at least hes got me doin this. phillips would have had be stuck in lab.
peggy carter,"and these are your only two options? a lab rat or a dancing monkey? you were meant for more than this, you know? [steve goes to respond but hesitates] what?"
steve rogers,"you know for the longest time i dreamed about coming overseas and be on the front lines. serving my country. i finally get everything i wanted, and im wearing tights."
peggy carter,schmidt sent out a force to rosano. two hundred men went up against him and less than fifty returned. your audience contained what was left of the one-oh-seventh. the rest were killed or captured.
steve rogers,the one-oh-seventh?
peggy carter,what?
steve rogers,colonel phillips?
col. chester phillips,"well, if it isnt the star spangled man with a plan. and what is your plan today?"
steve rogers,i need the casualty list for rosano.
col. chester phillips,"you dont get to give me orders, son."
steve rogers,i just need one name. sergeant james barnes from the hundred and seventh.
col. chester phillips,[pointing to peggy] you and i are gonna have a conversation later that you wont enjoy.
steve rogers,"please tell me if hes alive, sir. b-a-r..."
col. chester phillips,i can spell. [referring to barnes] i have signed more of these condolence letters today than i would care to count. but the name does sound familiar. im sorry.
steve rogers,what about the others? are you planning a rescue mission?
col. chester phillips,yeah! its called winning the war.
steve rogers,"but if you know where they are, why not at least...?"
col. chester phillips,"theyre thirty miles behind the lines. through the most heavily fortified territory in europe. wed lose more men than wed save. but i dont expect you to understand that, because youre a chorus girl."
steve rogers,i think i understand just fine.
col. chester phillips,"well then understand it somewhere else. if i read the posters correctly, you got some place to be in thirty minutes. [as phillips walks away steve looks at the military map which shows where the men are]"
steve rogers,"yes, sir. i do."
peggy carter,what do you plan to do? walk to austria?
steve rogers,if thats what it takes.
peggy carter,"you heard the colonel, youre friend is most likely dead."
steve rogers,you dont know that.
peggy carter,"even so, hes devising a strategy to take"
steve rogers,"by the time hes done that, it could be too late! you told me you thought i was meant for more than this. did you mean that?"
peggy carter,every word.
steve rogers,then you gotta let me go.
peggy carter,i can do more than that.
steve rogers,"[referring to stark and peggy helping him find barnes and the other missing soldiers] you know, you two are gonna be in a lot of trouble at the lab."
peggy carter,and you wont?
steve rogers,"where im goin, if anybody yells at me i can just shoot em."
peggy carter,they will undoubtedly shoot back.
steve rogers,"well, lets hope its good for somethin."
howard stark,"agent carter, if were not in too much of a hurry i thought we could stop off in lucerne for a late night fondue. [peggy looks awkwardly at steve]"
peggy carter,"stark is the best civilian pilot ive ever seen. hes mad enough to brave this airspace, were lucky to have him."
steve rogers,so are you two...? do you...? fondue? [as their plane is being attacked steve goes towards the opened door of the plane to jump]
peggy carter,get back here! were taking you all the way in.
steve rogers,"as soon as im free, turn this thing around and get the hell outta here!"
peggy carter,you cant give me orders!
steve rogers,the hell i cant! im a captain! [he looks at her and then jumps out of the plane] [as he finds some of the captured american soldiers]
gabe jones,who are you supposed to be?
steve rogers,im...captain america. get out fast and give em hell. ill meet you guys in the clearing with anybody else i find.
gabe jones,wait! you know what youre doin?
steve rogers,yeah. ive knocked out adolf hitler over two hundred times. [he finds barnes strapped to a chair in one of schmidts testing labs] its me. its steve. [he unstraps him from the chair]
james barnes,steve!
steve rogers,come on.
james barnes,steve.
steve rogers,i thought you were dead.
james barnes,i thought you were smaller. [referring to steves change of appearance] what happened to you?
steve rogers,i joined the army! [referring to steves undergoing change to a super-soldier]
james barnes,did it hurt?
steve rogers,a little.
james barnes,is it permanent?
steve rogers,so far!
johann schmidt,"captain america! how exciting! im a great fan of your films. so dr. erskine managed it after all. not exactly an improvement, but still impressive. [steve punches schmidt hard in the face]"
steve rogers,you got no idea.
johann schmidt,"havent i! [he goes to hit steve but steve protects himself with his shield] no matter what lies erskine told you, you see i was his greatest success! [he peels off the skin on his face to reveal that he is the red skull]"
johann schmidt,"you are deluded, captain. you pretend to be a simple soldier, but in reality you are just afraid to admit that we have left humanity behind. unlike you, i embrace it proudly. without fear!"
steve rogers,then how come youre running?
col. chester phillips,"i cant touch stark, hes rich and hes the armys number one weapons contractor. you are neither one!"
peggy carter,"with respect, sir, i dont regret my actions. and i dont think captain rogers did either."
col. chester phillips,"what makes you think i give a damn about your opinions. i took a chance with you, agent carter. and now americas golden boy and a lot of other good men are dead, cause you had a crush."
peggy carter,it wasnt that. i had faith.
col. chester phillips,"well, i hope thats big comfort to you when they shut this division down. [after steve has returned with the soldiers that schmidt was holding prisoner]"
steve rogers,id like to surrender myself for disciplinary action.
col. chester phillips,that wont be necessary.
steve rogers,"yes, sir. [he turns and walks away from steve and he notices peggy]"
col. chester phillips,"faith, huh? we are gonna set a fire under johann schmidts ass. what do you say, rogers? its your map, you think you can wipe hydra off of it?"
steve rogers,"yes, sir. ill need a team."
col. chester phillips,were already putting together the best men.
steve rogers,"with all due respect, sir. so am i."
james barnes,[referring to the rejection he got from peggy about going dancing with him] im invisible. im...im turning into you. its like some horrible dream.
steve rogers,dont take it so hard. maybe shes got a friend. [whilst waiting to see stark]
pvt. lorraine,read about what you did. [she hold up the newspaper showing his rescue mission]
steve rogers,"oh! the...yeah! well, thats you know? just doin what needed to be done."
pvt. lorraine,sounded like more than that. you saved nearly four hundred men.
steve rogers,"really, its not a big deal."
pvt. lorraine,tell that to their wives. [steve gets nervous as she walks up to him]
steve rogers,uh...i dont think they were all married.
pvt. lorraine,youre a hero.
steve rogers,"well, that...you know? that...that depends on the definition of it really. [she grabs hold of his tie]"
pvt. lorraine,"the women of america, they owe you their thanks. and uh...seeing as theyre not here. [drags him to the corner of the office and kisses him] [she catches steve kissing pvt. lorraine]"
peggy carter,captain! were ready for you. if youre not otherwise occupied.
steve rogers,"[annoyed, she turns and walks ahead] agent carter, wait."
peggy carter,looks like finding a partner wasnt that hard after all.
steve rogers,"peggy, thats not what you thought it was."
peggy carter,"i dont think anything, captain. not one thing. you always wanted to be soldier and now you are. just like all the rest."
steve rogers,"well, what about you and stark? how do i know you two havent been...fonduing?"
peggy carter,[she turns to look at him] you still dont know a bloody thing about women!
howard stark,"fondue is just cheese and bread, my friend."
steve rogers,really? i didnt think...
howard stark,"nor should you, pal. the moment you think you know whats goin on in a womans head, its the moment your goose is well and truly cooked. me, i concentrate on work. which at the moment is about making sure you and your men do not get killed. [referring to steves captain america shield] i hear youre uh...kinda attached?"
steve rogers,its handier than you might think.
howard stark,i took the liberty of coming up with some options. [shows him a few shields] this ones fun. shes been fitted with electrical relays. itll allow you to...
steve rogers,what about this one? [he picks up a round silver looking shield]
howard stark,no! no! thats just a prototype.
steve rogers,whats it made of?
howard stark,vibranium. its stronger than steel and a third of the weight. its completely vibration absorbent.
steve rogers,how come its not a standard issue?
howard stark,thats the rarest metal on earth. what youre holding there? thats all weve got.
steve rogers,"[as steve is checking out the shield made out of vibranium] you quite finished, mr. stark? im sure the captain has some unfinished business? [steve holds up the vibranium shield against him] what do you think? [peggy picks up gun and shoots it at steve as he quickly holds up the shield to protect himself]"
peggy carter,"yes. i think it works. [she puts the gun down and walks out of the lab, steve and howard looking at her stunned]"
steve rogers,i had some ideas about the uniform.
howard stark,"whatever you want, pal."
johann schmidt,"you are failing! we are close to and offensive network that will shake the planet. and yet we are continually delayed, because you cannot outwit a simpleton with a shield!"
dr. arnim zola,this is hardly my area of expertise! i...i merely develop the weapons. i...i cannot fire them.
johann schmidt,"finish your mission, doctor. before the american finishes his. [phillips brings a tray of food to zola after hes been captured and imprisoned]"
dr. arnim zola,what is this?
col. chester phillips,steak.
dr. arnim zola,what is in it?
col. chester phillips,"cow. doctor, do you realize how difficult it is to get hold of a prime cut like that out here?"
dr. arnim zola,i dont eat meat.
col. chester phillips,why not?
dr. arnim zola,it disagrees with me.
col. chester phillips,"how about cyanide? does that give you the rumbly tummy too? every hydra agent that weve tried to take alive has crunched a little pill before we can stop him. but not you! so, heres my brilliant theory. you wanna live."
dr. arnim zola,"youre trying to intimidate me, colonel."
col. chester phillips,i bought you dinner. [passes him a piece of paper which zola reads out loud]
dr. arnim zola,"given the variable information he has provided, and in exchange for his full cooperation, dr. zola is being remanded to switzerland."
col. chester phillips,"i sent that message to washington this morning. of course it was encoded. you guys havent broken those codes, have you? that would be awkward."
dr. arnim zola,schmidt will know this is a lie.
col. chester phillips,"hes gonna kill you anyway, doc. youre a liability. you know more about schmidt than anyone. and the last guy you cost us was captain rogers closest friend. so, i wouldnt count on the very best of protection. theres you, or schmidt. its just the hand youve been dealt."
dr. arnim zola,schmidt believes he walks in the foot steps of the gods.
col. chester phillips,mmm.
dr. arnim zola,only the world itself will satisfy him.
col. chester phillips,"you do realize thats nuts, dont you?"
dr. arnim zola,but the sanity of the plan is of no consequence.
col. chester phillips,and why is that?
dr. arnim zola,because he can do it!
col. chester phillips,whats his target?
dr. arnim zola,his target...is everywhere.
johann schmidt,"[addressing his hydra soldiers] tomorrow, hydra will stand master of the world. born to victory on the wings of the valkyrie. our enemies weapons will be powerless against us. if they shoot down one plane, hundreds more will rain fire upon them! if they cut off one head, two more shall take its place. heil hydra! [he soldiers all start saluting and shouting heil hydra]"
steve rogers,"[pouring himself some drink] dr. erskine said that the serum wouldnt just effect my muscles, it would effect my cells. create a protective system of regeneration and healing. which means um...i cant get drunk. did you know that?"
peggy carter,your metabolism burns four times faster than the average person. he thought it could be one of the side effects. [referring to barnes getting killed] it wasnt your fault.
steve rogers,did you read the reports?
peggy carter,yes.
steve rogers,then you know thats not true.
peggy carter,you did everything you could. did you believe in your friend? did you respect him? [steve looks at her as if to say yes] then stop blaming yourself. allow barnes the dignity of his choice. he damn well must have thought you were worth it.
steve rogers,im goin after schmidt. im not gonna stop till all of hydra is dead or captured.
peggy carter,you wont be alone. [the team prepare a battle plan to take down red skull at his headquarters]
col. chester phillips,"johann schmidt belongs in a bug house. he thinks hes a god. hes willing to blow half the world prove it, starting with the u.s.a."
howard stark,"schmidts working with powers beyond our capabilities. he gets across the atlantic, he will wipe out the entire eastern sea board in an hour."
gabe jones,how much time we got?
col. chester phillips,"according to my new best friend, twenty four hours. hydras last base is here. [holding a photo he points to the base] in the alps. five hundred feet below the surface."
jim morita,"so, what are we supposed to do. i mean, its not like we can just knock on the front door."
steve rogers,why not? thats exactly what were gonna do. [after steve has been captured by hydra soldiers and brought to schmidts weapon lab]
johann schmidt,"arrogance may not be a uniquely american trait, but i must say you do it better than anyone. but there are limits to what even you can do, captain. or did erskine tell you otherwise?"
steve rogers,he told me you were insane.
johann schmidt,"ah. he resented my genius and tried to deny me what was rightfully mine. but he gave you everything. so, what made you so special?"
steve rogers,nothin. im just a kid from brooklyn. [after schmidt has beaten him] i can do this all day.
johann schmidt,"oh, of course you can. of course. but unfortunately i am on a tight schedule. [schmidt takes out his cube-energy pistol and points it at steve]"
steve rogers,so am i! [just then steves team crash through the windows of the weapons lab] [just as steve is about to leap from the roadster onto schmidts plane peggy stops him]
peggy carter,wait! [she kisses him] go get him. [steve surprised by the kiss looks at phillips]
col. chester phillips,im not kissin you! [after schmidt has been killed steve takes over the planes controls and radios peggy]
peggy carter,"steve, is that you? are you alright?"
steve rogers,peggy! schmidts dead.
peggy carter,what about the plane?
steve rogers,thats a little bit tougher to explain.
peggy carter,"give me your coordinates, ill find you a safe landing site."
steve rogers,theres not going to be a safe landing. but i can try and force it down.
peggy carter,"ill get howard on the line, hell know what to do."
steve rogers,"theres not enough time. this things moving too fast and its heading for new york. [referring to schmidts plane, speaking through the planes control] i gotta put her in the water."
peggy carter,"please, dont do this. we have time. we can work it out."
steve rogers,"right now im in the middle of nowhere. if i wait any longer a lot of people are gonna die. peggy, this is my choice. [as hes forcing the plane down towards the water] peggy?"
peggy carter,im here.
steve rogers,im gonna need a rain check on that dance.
peggy carter,"[with tears in her eyes] alright. a week, next saturday, at the stork club."
steve rogers,you got it.
peggy carter,eight oclock on the dot. dont you dare be late! understood?
steve rogers,"you know, i still dont know how to dance."
peggy carter,ill show you how. just be there.
steve rogers,youll have the band play somethin slow. id hate to step on your... [the line goes static and peggy begins to cry]
peggy carter,"steve? steve? steve? [after steve has been missing for some time, we see him awaken in a 1940s hospital and he can hear a baseball game on an old radio when a woman walks into the room]"
shield agent,"good morning. or should i say, afternoon."
steve rogers,where am i?
shield agent,youre in a recovery room in new york city.
steve rogers,[he looks at her suspiciously] where am i really?
shield agent,im afraid i dont understand.
steve rogers,"the game, its from may, nineteen forty one. i know, cause i was there. [he gets up from the bed] now, im gonna ask you again. where am i?"
shield agent,captain rogers?
steve rogers,who are you? [two soldiers in black uniform enter the room and steve knocks them through the wall]
shield agent,"captain rogers, wait! [steve sees that hes on a some kind of made up set and he runs out of there] [last lines; after steve finds himself in 2011s time square he looks around him in shock, numerous suvs encircle him and fury steps out of one of the vehicles]"
nick fury,"at ease soldier! look, im sorry about that little show back there. but we thought it best to break it to you slowly."
steve rogers,break what?
nick fury,"youve been asleep, cap. for almost seventy years. [steve looks around him in shock] are you gonna be okay?"
steve rogers,"yeah. yeah. i just...i had a date. [lines after end of credits; steves is pummeling a punching bag in a gym and in anger knocks it off its chain, sending it flying across the room when fury enters the gym]"
nick fury,trouble sleeping?
steve rogers,"are you here with a mission, sir?"
nick fury,i am.
steve rogers,trying to get me back in the world?
nick fury,trying to save it.
