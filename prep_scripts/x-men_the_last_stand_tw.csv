Eric,I still dont know why Im here. Couldnt you just make them say yes?
Charles,"Yes, I could, but its not my way. And I would expect you, of all people, would understand my feelings on misuse of power."
Eric,"Ah, power corrupts and all that. Yes, I know, Charles. - When are you going to stop lecturing me?"
Charles,When you start listening. Youre here because I need you.
Eric,We dont have to meet every one of them in person?
Charles,No. This ones special.
Mrs. Grey,"What a beautiful campus. John, dont you think?"
Mr. Grey,"Yeah, the brochure is great. But what about Jean? What about her illness?"
Eric,Illness?
Mrs. Grey,John.
Eric,"You think your daughter is sick, Mr. Grey?"
Charles,Perhaps it would be best if we were to speak to her. Alone.
Mrs. Grey,"Of course. Jean, can you come down, dear?"
Mr. Grey,"Well leave you, then."
Charles,"Its very rude to read my thoughts, or Mr. Lensherrs, without our permission."
Eric,"Did you think you were the only one of your kind, young lady?"
Charles,"Were mutants, Jean. Were like you."
Young Jean,Really? I doubt that.
Eric,"Oh, Charles. I like this one."
Charles,"You have more power than you can imagine, Jean. The question is, will you control that power? Or let it control you?"
Mr. Worthington,"Warren? Son, is everything all right? - Whats going on?"
Warren,Nothing. Ill be right out.
Mr. Worthington,Come on. Youve been in there for over an hour. Open the door. Warren.
Warren,One second!
Mr. Worthington,"Open this door. Warren. Let me in there right now. Open the door. Oh, God. - Not you."
Warren,"Dad, Im sorry. - Not you. - Dad, Im sorry."
Logan,The whole worlds going to hell and youre just going to sit there? Lets go.
Kitty,Bobby!
Bobby,"Thanks, Kitty."
Storm,Were getting killed out here.
Logan,"Yeah, I know. Theyre not ready, Storm."
Storm,Logan.
Logan,"Oh, dont get your panties in a bunch. That was my last cigar."
Storm,Logan.
Kitty,Its getting closer.
Logan,"Come on. Lets keep moving. Hey, Tin Man. Come here. - Hows your throwing arm?"
Storm,"Logan, we work as a team."
Logan,Yeah. Good luck with that. Throw me. Now.
Storm,"Dammit, Logan, dont do this."
Logan,"Class dismissed. Hey, Colossus. Nice throw."
Computer,Simulation complete.
Storm,What was that?
Logan,Danger room session.
Storm,You know what I mean.
Logan,Lighten up.
Storm,You cant change the rules.
Loggan,Im trying to teach em something. - I taught em something.
Storm,It was a defensive exercise.
Logan,"Yeah, best defense is a good offence. Or is it the other way round?"
Storm,"This isnt a game, Logan."
Logan,"Well, you sure fooled me. Hey, Im just a sub. You got a problem, talk to Scott."
Jeans voice,Scott!
Scott,Jean.
Jeans voice,Scott. Scott. Scott. Scott.
Bobby,Are you OK?
Marie,Im fine.
Bobby,You seem like youre avoiding me. Somethings wrong.
Marie,I cant touch my boyfriend without killing him. Other than that Im wonderful.
Bobby,Hey. I dont think thats fair. Have I ever put any pressure on you?
Marie,"Youre a guy, Bobby. Your minds only on one thing."
Logan,They were looking for you. You didnt show.
Scott,What do you care?
Logan,"For starters, I had to cover your ass."
Scott,I didnt ask you to.
Logan,"No, you didnt. The professor did. - I was just passing through."
Scott,"So pass through, Logan."
Logan,"Hey, look. - I know how you feel. When Jean died..."
Scott,Dont.
Logan,Maybe its time for us to move on.
Scott,"Not everybody heals as fast as you, Logan."
Staff Woman,Mr. Secretary.
Hank,Yes?
Staff Woman,"The meetings begun, sir."
Hank,Thank you.  Mr. President.
President,"Have a seat, Hank. Homeland Security was tracking Magneto. We got hits in Lisbon, Geneva, Montreal. NAVSAT lost him crossing the border, but we did get a consolation prize. We picked her up breaking into the FDA. You know who shes been imitating? Secretary Trask here."
Hank,"Yes, sir. She can do that."
President,"Not any more, she cant. We got her."
Hank,You think your prisons can hold her?
President,We have some new prisons. Well keep them mobile. Be a step ahead.
Interrogator,"Where is Magneto? Raven? - Raven, I asked you a question."
Raven,I dont answer to my slave name.
Interrogator,"Raven Darkholme. Thats your real name, isnt it? Or has he convinced you you dont have a family any more?"
Raven,"My family tried to kill me, you pathetic meat sack."
Interrogator,"OK, then. Mystique - where is he?"
Raven,In here with us.
Interrogator,I dont want to play games with you. I want answers.
Raven,You dont want to play games with me?
Interrogator,"You are going to stop this. Tell me, where is Magneto?"
Raven,You wanna know where he is? Homo sapien.
Hank,"You know, her capture will only provoke Magneto, but having her does give us some diplomatic leverage."
President,"On principle, I cant negotiate with these people."
Hank,"I thought thats why you appointed me, sir."
President,"Yes, it is. - But thats not why you called me here. - No. This is. Its what she stole from the FDA."
Hank,Dear Lord. - Is it viable?
President,- We believe it is.
Hank,You realize the impact thisll have on the mutant community?
President,Yes. I do. Thats precisely why we need some of your diplomacy now.
Charles,"When an individual acquires great power, the use or misuse of that power is everything. Will it be for the greater good or will it be used for personal or for destructive ends? Now, this is a question we must all ask ourselves. Why? Because we are mutants. For psychics, this presents a particular problem. When is it acceptable to use our power and when do we cross that invisible line that turns us into tyrants over our fellow man?"
Kitty,But Einstein said that ethics are an exclusive human concern without any superhuman authority behind it.
Charles,"Einstein wasnt a mutant so far as we know. This case study was sent to me by a colleague, Dr. Moira McTaggert. Jones."
Moira,"The man you see here was born with no higher-level brain functions. His organs and nervous system work, but he has no consciousness to speak of."
Charles,"What if we were to transfer the consciousness of one person, say a father of four with terminal cancer, into the body of this man? How are we to decide what falls within the range of ethical behavior and what..."
Kitty,Professor?
Charles,Well continue this tomorrow. Class dismissed. The forecast was for sunny skies.
Storm,Im sorry.
Charles,I dont have to be psychic to see that somethings bothering you.
Storm,"I dont understand. Magnetos a fugitive, weve a mutant in the cabinet, a president who understands us - why hide?"
Charles,Were not hiding. But we still have enemies. I must protect my students. You know that.
Storm,"Yes, but we cant be students forever."
Charles,"Storm, I havent thought of you as my student for years. In fact, I thought that perhaps you might take my place some day."
Storm,But Scotts...
Charles,"Scotts a changed man. He took Jeans death so hard. Yes, things are better out there, but you, of all people, know how fast the weather can change."
Storm,Theres something youre not telling us. Hank?
Hank,Ororo. Charles.
Storm,I love what youve done with your hair.
Hank,You too. Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.
Charles,"Henry, you are always welcome here. Youre a part of this place."
Hank,I have news.
Charles,Is it Eric?
Hank,No. Though we have been making some progress on that front. - Mystique was recently apprehended.
Logan,Whos the fur ball?
Hank,Hank McCoy. Secretary of Mutant Affairs.
Logan,"Right, right. The secretary. Nice suit."
Charles,"Henry, this is Logan. Hes..."
Hank,Wolverine. - I hear youre quite an animal.
Logan,Look whos talking.
Storm,Magnetos gonna come get Mystique.
Hank,Magnetos not the problem. At least not our most pressing one. A major pharmaceutical company has developed a mutant antibody. A way to suppress the mutant X gene.
Storm,Suppress?
Hank,Permanently. Theyre calling it a cure.
Storm,Thats ridiculous. You cant cure being a mutant.
Hank,Scientifically speaking...
Storm,When did we become a disease?
Charles,Storm. Theyre announcing it now.
Mr. Worthington,"These so-called mutants are people just like us. Their affliction is nothing more than a disease, a corruption of healthy cellular activity. But I stand here today to tell you that theres hope. This site, once the worlds most famous prison, will now be the source of freedom for all mutants who choose it. Ladies and gentlemen... I proudly present the answer to mutation. Finally, we have a cure."
Storm,"Who would want this cure? I mean, what kind of coward would take it just to fit in?"
Hank,Is it cowardice to save oneself from persecution?
Logn,Not all of us can fit in so easily.
Hank,You dont shed on the furniture.
Logan,The government probably cooked this up.
Hank,The government had nothing to do with it.
Logan,Ive heard that before.
Hank,"My boy, I have been fighting for mutant rights since before you had claws."
Logan,Did he just call me boy?
Marie,Is it true? They can cure us?
Charles,"Yes, Rogue. It appears to be true."
Storm,"No. Professor. They cant cure us. You wanna know why? Because theres nothing to cure. Nothings wrong with you. Or any of us, for that matter."
Mutant,"How should we, as mutants, respond? Heres what I think. This is about getting organized. Bringing our complaints to the right people. We need to put together a committee and talk to the government.  They dont understand. They dont know what it means to be a mutant. We need to show them, educate them, let them know that were here to stay. People, you must listen. They wont take us seriously..."
Psylocke,They wanna exterminate us.
Mutant,This cure is voluntary. Nobody is talking about extermination.
Eric,"No one ever talks about it. They just do it. And youll go on with your lives ignoring the signs all around you. And then one day, when the air is still and the night has fallen, they come for you. Then you realize, while youre talking about organizing and committees, the extermination has already begun. Make no mistake, my brothers. They will draw first blood. They will force their cure upon us. The only question is, will you join my brotherhood and fight? Or wait for the inevitable genocide? Who will you stand with? The humans? Or us?"
Quill,You talk pretty tough for a guy in a cape.
John,Back off.
Calisto,"If youre so proud of being a mutant, wheres your mark?"
Eric,"I have been marked once, my dear. Let me assure you. No needle shall ever touch my skin again."
John,You know who youre talking to?
Quill,Do you?
Eric,And what can you do?  So you have talents?
Calisto,"That and more. I know you control metal. And I know theres 87 mutants in here, none above a class three. Other than you two."
Eric,You can sense other mutants and their powers? Could you locate one for me?
President,Let me out of here. I demand that you release me. Do you know who I am? Im the president of the United States.
Guard,"Oh, Mr. President. Shut up."
Little Girl,Why are you doing this to me? Let me down. Ill be a good girl. Please let me go. Please.
Guard,"Keep it up. Ill spray you in the face, bitch."
Little Girl,"When I get out of here, Im going to kill you myself."
Guard,"Yeah, right."
Dr. Rao,"Secretary McCoy, welcome to Worthington Labs."
Hank,"Thank you, Dr. Rao. Not an easy place to get to."
Dr. Rao,Its the safest location we could find. Thats why we keep the source of the cure here.
Hank,He is a mutant. You understand our concern.
Dr. Rao,We are in compliance with your policy.
Hank,How long will you keep the boy here?
Dr. Rao,"Until we can fully map his DNA. We can replicate it, but we cant generate it."
Hank,And his power? What is its range?
Dr. Rao,Youll see. Jimmy. Theres someone I would like you to meet.
Hank,"Hello there, son."
Jimmy,Hi.
Hank,My name is Hank McCoy.
Jimmy,Im sorry.
Hank,"Its OK. You have an amazing gift. Thank you, Jimmy."
Dr. Rao,"Extraordinary, isnt he?"
Hank,"Yes, he is."
Jeans voice,Scott. Scott. Scott. - Can you hear me? Im still here. Scott.
Scott,Stop.
Jeans voice,Im here. Scott. Scott.
Scott,Stop it.
Jeans voice,Scott. Scott.
Scott,Stop it.
Jeans voice,"I need you, Scott. Scott. Scott."
Scott,Stop! Jean?
Jean,Scott.
Scott,How?
Jean,I dont know. I wanna see your eyes. - Take these off.
Scott,No. No.
Jean,Trust me. I can control it now. Open them. You cant hurt me.
Logan,What happened?
Storm,"No clue. - Professor, are you OK?"
Charles,Get to Alkali Lake.
Logan,You dont want to be here.
Storm,Do you?
Logan,I cant see a damn thing.
Storm,I can take care of that.
Logan,What the...
Storm,Logan! Shes alive.
Logan,Jean.
Charles,The sheer mass of water that collapsed on top of Jean should have obliterated her. The only explanation of Jeans survival is that her powers wrapped her in a cocoon of telekinetic energy.
Logan,Is she gonna be OK?
Charles,"Jean Grey is the only class five mutant Ive ever encountered, her potential limitless. Her mutation is seated in the unconscious part of her mind and therein lay the danger. When she was a girl, I created a series of psychic barriers to isolate her powers from her conscious mind. - Jean developed a dual personality."
Logan,What?
Charles,"The conscious Jean, whose powers were always in her control, and the dormant side. A personality that, in our sessions, came to call itself the Phoenix. A purely instinctual creature, all desire and joy and rage."
Logan,She knew all this?
Charles,"Its unclear how much she knew. Far more critical is whether the woman in front of us is the Jean Grey we know, or the Phoenix furiously struggling to be free."
Logan,She looks peaceful to me.
Charles,Im keeping her that way. Im trying to restore the psychic blocks and cage the beast again.
Logan,What have you done to her?
Charles,You have to understand...
Logan,Youre talking about a persons mind.
Charles,She has to be controlled.
Logan,"Controlled? Sometimes, when you cage the beast, the beast gets angry."
Charles,You have no idea. You have no idea of what she is capable of.
Logan,"No, Professor. I had no idea what you were capable of."
Charles,I had a terrible choice to make. I chose the lesser of two evils.
Logan,It sounds to me like Jean had no choice at all.
Charles,"I dont have to explain myself, least of all to you."
Reporter,"History will be made here today. For the first time, the so-called mutant cure will be available to the public. Reaction has run the gamut with mutants on both sides of the line. Some are desperate for this cure while others are offended by the very idea of it."
Mr. Worthington,Will Secretary McCoy be a problem?
Dr. Rao,Hard to say. His political views seem somewhat at odds with his personal issues.
Lady,"Excuse me, sir. Your sons arrived."
Mr. Worthington,Good. Bring him in.
Dr. Rao,Are you sure you want to start with him?
Mr. Worthington,"I think its important. Yes. - Hello, Warren. - How are you, son? - Did you sleep well?"
Warren,Yeah.
Mr. Worthington,"You know, Im proud of you for doing this. Everythings gonna be fine. I promise. You ready?"
Dr. Rao,The transformation can be a little jarring.
Warren,"Dad, can we talk about this for a second?"
Mr. Worthington,"Weve talked about it, son. Itll all be over soon. - Everythings going to be fine."
Warren,Wait. I cant do this.
Mr. Worthington,"Warren, calm down."
Warren,I cant do this.
Mr. Worthington,"Yes, you can."
Warren,I cant do this!
Mr. Worthington,"Just relax, son. Take it easy. Calm down. - I promise you it will be fine. Warren, relax. - Dad. Warren, its a better life. - Its what we all want."
Warren,No. Its what you want.
Mr. Worthington,"Warren, no!"
Raven,Told you so. About time.
Eric,Ive been busy. Did you find what you were looking for?
Raven,"The source of the cure is a mutant. A child at Worthington Labs. Without him, they have nothing."
Eric,Read us the guest list.
John,"""Cell 41205. James Madrox."""
Raven,This one robbed seven banks. - At the same time.
Eric,I could use a man of your talents.
James,Im in.
Eric,Welcome to the Brotherhood.
Raven,Careful with this one.
John,"""Cain Marko. Solitary confinement."" Check this out. ""Prisoner must be confined at all times."" ""If he builds any momentum, no outside object can stop him."""
Eric,How fascinating. - What do they call you?
Cain,Juggernaut.
Eric,I cant imagine why.
Cain,You could let me out of here. I need a pee.
John,Nice helmet.
Cain,Thanks. Keeps my face pretty.
Eric,I think hell make a fine addition to our army.
Raven,No!
Eric,You saved me.
Raven,Eric.
Eric,"Im sorry, my dear. Youre not one of us any more. Such a shame. She was so beautiful."
President,Think resigning will make a difference?
Hank,"Thats no way to influence policy. Policy is being made without me, Mr. President. The decision to turn the cure into a weapon was made without me. What happened on that convoy was inexcusable. But your actions..."
President,That was an isolated incident. You have to understand those mutants were a real threat.
Hank,Have you even begun to think what a slippery slope youre on?
President,I have. And I worry about how democracy survives when one man can move cities with his mind.
Hank,As do I.
President,You and I know that its only going to get worse.
Hank,All the more reason why I need to be where I belong.
Logan,Jean.
Jean,"Hi, Logan."
Logan,Welcome back.
Jean,Back where we first met. Only I was in your place and you were in mine.
Logan,Are you OK?
Jean,"Yeah. More than OK. Logan, youre making me blush."
Logan,Youre reading my thoughts?
Jean,I dont have to. Its OK. Its OK.
Logan,Wait. - No. Jean. - This isnt you.
Jean,"Yes, it is me."
Logan,No. Maybe you ought to take it easy. The professor said you might be different.
Phoenix,"He would know, wouldnt he?"
Logan,What? You think hes not in your head too?
Phoenix,"Look at you, Logan. Hes tamed you."
Logan,Wheres Scott? Jean?
Jean,Where am I?
Logan,"Youre in the mansion. You need to tell me what happened to Scott. Jean, tell me what happened to him."
Jean,"Oh, God."
Logan,"Look at me. Stay with me. Talk to me. - Look at me. Look at me. - No. Focus. Focus, Jean."
Jean,Kill me.
Logan,What?
Jean,Kill me before I kill someone else.
Logan,Dont say that.
Jean,Please.
Logan,Stop it.
Jean,Kill me.
Logan,Stop it. Look at me. Look at me. Jean. Itll be all right. We can help you. Hey. The professor can help. He can fix it.
Phoenix,I dont want to fix it.
Eric,Voluntary? They put the cure in a gun. I told you they would draw first blood.
John,So what do we do? - What do we do?
Eric,We use this weapon as a lightning rod to bring countless more to our cause. Come. We have an army to build.
CaIisto,I picked something up. An electromagnetic force. Its massive. Its a mutant. Class five. More powerful than anything Ive ever felt. More powerful than you.
Eric,Where is she?
Storm,Logan.
Logan,Jean. Jean.
Storm,What happened?
Charles,What have you done?
Logan,I think she killed Scott.
Storm,What? - Thats not possible.
Charles,"I warned you. Shes left the mansion, but shes trying to block my thoughts. Shes so strong. It may be too late. - Wait for me here."
Logan,What?
Charles,I need to see Jean alone.
Eric,"You were right, Charles. - This one is special."
Logan,What the hell are you doing here?
Eric,Same as the professor. Visiting an old friend.
Charles,I dont want trouble here.
Eric,"Nor do I. So, shall we go inside?"
Charles,I came to bring Jean home. Dont interfere.
Eric,"Just like old times, eh?"
Charles,She needs help. Jean is not well.
Eric,"Funny, you sound just like her parents. Nobody gets inside."
Phoenix,I knew youd come.
Charles,Of course. Ive come to bring you home.
Phoenix,I have no home.
Charles,"Yes, you do. You have a home and a family."
Eric,"You know he thinks your power is too great for you to control. I dont believe your mind games are going to work any more, Charles."
Phoenix,So you want to control me?
Eric,He does.
Charles,No. I want to help you.
Phoenix,Help me? Whats wrong with me?
Eric,Absolutely nothing.
Charles,"Eric, stop."
Eric,"No, Charles, not this time. Youve always held her back."
Charles,"For your own good, Jean."
