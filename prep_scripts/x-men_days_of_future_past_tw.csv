narrator,new york - mutants and the humans have been gathered by an army of robots to be killed
professor x,"(voice over) the future, a dark, desolate world. a world of war, suffering, loss on both sides. mutants, and the humans who dared to help them, fighting an enemy we cannot defeat. [a young mutant is seen walking through piles of dirt and carcasses] are we destined down this path? destined to destroy ourselves like so many species before us? or can we evolve fast enough to change ourselves, change our fate?"
narrator,"the mutant kneels down and brushes off some dirt on the ground from an object with the mutant academys x on it. suddenly theres a low rumbling noise, and as the mutant turns to see what it is a light is flashed across the mutants face"
professor x,is the future truly set?
narrator,cue main titles
narrator,"in moscow a mutant, warpath, spots several pods carrying robots and dropping them near the building theyre ransacking"
warpath,theyre here!
narrator,"he joins another mutant, blink. using her powers she opens a portal to transport them to the lower level to warn their fellow mutants: colossus, sunspot, bishop and kitty pryde"
blink,times up.
sunspot,sentinels!
bishop,sunspot!
narrator,sunspot uses his power to create solar power energy which bishop uses with his powers to absorb and power up his weapon
kitty,lets go.
narrator,"bishop and kitty start running and kitty uses her power so that she and bishop can phases through walls as the others wait to fight the sentinels. when they arrive the team of mutants begin to fight the sentinels. bobby/iceman also arrives to join them, but the sentinels kill them all by latching onto the mutants to adapt to their powers, copying them and use their powers against them"
warpath,run!
blink,go!
narrator,kitty takes bishop into a vault and starts to create a link with his consciousness. at the same time blink goes to help warpath fight the sentinels when one of them strikes her down
warpath,blink! no!
narrator,"she falls and dies. the remaining sentinels quickly kill warpath as he tries to protect the vault, and one of the sentinels breaks into the vault"
kitty,"too late, assholes."
narrator,just as the sentinel is about to kill bishop and kitty they disappear as they are transported out of there
guard,"dont move, you mutant scum!"
guy,no!
guard,"flat on the ground, hands behind your head!"
narrator,professor x is using his powers to find other mutants
professor x,(voice over) so few of us left.
kitty,professor?
professor x,ive found them.
narrator,"an x-jet descends in china to where professor x, storm, logan and magneto dismount at a monastery, they are met by bishop, sunspot and warpath, who are both alive"
bobby,professor!
narrator,"then we see bobby, who is also alive"
storm,bobby.
bobby,"hey, storm."
narrator,they embrace
wolverine,"hey, kid."
narrator,bobby nods his head to logan
kitty,"professor, you made it."
narrator,"she joins them along with colossus, who is also alive"
kitty,"whenever the sentinels attack, warpath spots them... then i send bishop back to warn us of the attack before it happens. blink scouts the exit site... and then we leave before they ever know we were there."
warpath,because... we never were.
wolverine,what do you mean you were never there?
professor x,she projects bishop back in time a few days to warn the others... of the coming attack.
wolverine,so she needs bishop back in time?
professor x,"no, just his consciousness, into his younger self. his younger body."
wolverine,wow.
magneto,"this might just work, charles."
kitty,what might work?
professor x,"the sentinel program was originally conceived by doctor bolivar trask. in the early 70s, he was one of the worlds leading weapons designers. but, covertly, he had begun experimenting on mutants... using their gifts to fuel his own research."
trask(flashback),this is extraordinary.
professor x,there was one mutant who has discovered what he was doing.
magneto,a mutant with the ability to transform herself into anyone.
colossus,mystique.
professor x,"i knew her as raven. we me when we were children, grew up together. she was like a sister to me. i tried to help her... but only succeeded in driving her away. she haunted trask across the world. and at the paris peace accords in 1973, after the vietnam war, she found trask... and killed him. it was the first time she killed."
wolverine,it wasnt her last.
professor x,"but killing trask did not have the outcome she expected. it only persuaded the government of the need for his program. they captured her that day... tortured her, experimented on her. in her dna, they discovered the secrets to her powers of transformation. it gave them the key they needed, to create weapons that could adapt to any mutant power. and in less than 50 years, the machines that have destroyed so many of our kind were created. but it all started that day in 1973, the day she first killed, the day she truly became... mystique."
kitty,you want to go back there.
professor x,"if i can get to her, stop the assassination... keep her out off their hands... then we can stop the sentinels from ever being born."
magneto,and end this war before it ever begins.
kitty,"uh, i can send someone back a couple weeks. maybe a month. but youre talking about going back decades. you have the the most powerful brain in the world, professor... but the mind can only stretch so far before it snaps. it would you rip apart. im sorry. no one could survive that trip."
wolverine,what if someones mind has a way of snapping back? what if someone can heal as fast as theyre ripped apart?
narrator,outside the monastery as they prepare to protect logan as he goes back in time
storm,"okay, spread out."
bishop,take your positions.
narrator,"being prepped for time travel inside the monastery, while the remaining x-men and the free mutants lead by bishop and warpath stand guard outside keeping a look out for sentinels."
wolverine,"so i wake up in my younger body, god knows where. then what?"
professor x,youll need to go to my house and find me. convince me of all of this.
wolverine,wont you be able to just read my mind?
professor x,"i didnt have my powers in 1973. logan, youre going to have to do for me what i once did for you. lead me, guide me. i was a very different man then. youll have to be patient with me."
wolverine,patience is my strongest suit.
magneto,youll need me as well.
wolverine,what?
magneto,"after mystique left charles, she came with me... and i set her on a dangerous path. a darker path. its going to take the two of us, side by side... at a time when we couldnt be further apart."
narrator,professor x agrees with magneto.
wolverine,great. so where do i find you?
magneto,"well, its complicated."
narrator,logan is lying down as kitty prepares him
kitty,"basically, your body will go to sleep. while your mind travels back in time. as long as youre back there, past and present will continue to coexist. but you once wake up... whatever youve done will take hold and become history. and for the rest of us, it will be the only history that we know. it will be like the last that 50 years never happened. and this world, and this war... the only person who remember it is you. all right, logan... i need you to clear your head and to stay as calm as possible."
wolverine,what? what do you mean?
kitty,"if your mind gets rocky, it will be harder for me to hold you... and you could start to slip between past and future."
wolverine,what if i need to get a little rocky?
kitty,think peaceful thoughts?
wolverine,peaceful thoughts... do you have any good news?
kitty,"well, you dont really age, so youll pretty much look the same."
bobby,you wont have much the time in the past. the sentinels will find us. they always do.
kitty,"and this time, we wont be able to run. well have no escape. this is our last chance!"
magneto,you really think this work?
professor x,"i have faith in him. its not him im worried about, its us."
magneto,we were young... we didnt know any better.
professor x,we will now.
wolverine,see you all soon.
kitty,this might sting a little.
narrator,as kitty forms the link to logans consciousness he yells out in pain and his claws extend
wolverine,(screaming)
narrator,"logan wakes up in 1973 and the first thing he sees is a lava lamp, he finds himself lying naked in a waterbed next to a woman, he rises and goes to look at himself in the mirror, then looks out the window to see a busy city in 70s"
past wolverine,"whoa. holy shit. it worked. hey, whats going on?"
ramone,gwen get dressed.
past wolverine,"who the hell are you? hey, i dont know whats going on."
ramone,whats going on youre supposed to be guarding the bosss daughter not screwing her.
past wolverine,"well, i didnt sleep with her."
ramone,no?
past wolverine,"no. i mean, yes, i slept with her many times."
gwen,jimmy!
past wolverine,that wasnt me. that was the old me. i just got here 20 seconds ago.
ramone,really? then what happened to your clothes?
past wolverine,my... oh. would you believe me if i told you i was sent here from the future?
gwen,huh?
ramone,"get out of here, sweetheart."
past wolverine,yeah.
ramone,were gonna take care of this comedian.
past wolverine,"no, youre not. youre gonna give me the keys to your car and some money for gas... or youre gonna wake me up in the hospital. trust me, i know how these things play out."
ramone,oh. because youre from the future?
past wolverine,no. because of these. what the hell? god damn it!
narrator,logan takes them all down
past wolverine,peaceful thoughts.
narrator,"in washington d.c., trask is meeting with congress to lobby his sentinel program"
senator brickman,we are reviewing all of our defense expenditures... and all the black books are being opened. we cant support a weapon that targets our own citizens. if these mutants as you describe... are already living among us... then they are living here peacefully. we havent had an incident in over 10 years.
senator brickman,we are talking about a tenth of a tenth... of a tenth population.
dr. trask,allow me to read something to you.
senator parker,please.
narrator,members of congress laugh quietly
senator brickman,"speak for yourself, dr. trask."
narrator,theres a low chuckle by trask and some of the congressmen
dr. trask,"[warning congress] you know, when you sent our soldiers to vietnam without the weapons they needed to win the war, you underestimated your enemy. you do that with this enemy and it wont be some border skirmish halfway around the world. this time, the war will be for our streets, our cities, our homes. by the time you see the need for my program, itll be too late and youll have lost two wars in one lifetime."
senator brickman,"[believing trask is insane and paranoid] were sorry dr. trask, but your sentinel program it aint going to fly!"
narrator,saigon - colonel sanders arrives at a quarantined tent guarded by mps
soldier,"can i help you, colonel?"
colonel,just here to give our boys a proper send-off.
soldier,"im sorry, sir, but we have orders. this is a quarantined area."
colonel,"stand aside, solider. thats an order. [the guards stand aside and open the doors to let sanders through to the tent]"
soldier,atten-hut!
narrator,the soldiers all rise
colonel,"at ease. [as sanders walks through the tent he looks at the mutant soldiers, he notices alex summers/havok and winks at him, alex looks at him with confusion, strand goes over the doctor whos collecting blood samples] whats all this?"
soldier,"lab reports, blood tests. its all getting packing up and shipped back."
colonel,where is it going?
soldier,same place they are. trask industries.
narrator,major william stryker enters the tent
stryker,"lets go, gentlemen. im taking you out of this shit show."
havok,shipping home?
stryker,not just yet.
narrator,another solider opens a case containing vials of drugs
toad,what are you doing with those?
stryker,something to make the ride a little smoother. im transferring you to a private facility... where we can run a few more tests.
narrator,as the soldier prepares the injection sanders walks over to stryker
colonel,your men are not military.
stryker,private outfit. [stryker gives sanders his paperwork] were authorized to remand these men.
colonel,[sanders looks at the papers] hmm. these troops are going home.
stryker,"well, colonel, i dont believe you have jurisdiction in this matter."
colonel,"im afraid i do, son."
stryker,"im sorry, who are you?"
narrator,sanders turns strykers dog tags around to look at his name
colonel,"the question is, major... ...who are you?"
narrator,"suddenly sanders turns into mystique, she and the other mutants take down the soldiers"
narrator,"as stryker goes to grab his gun, raven grabs hold of his throat and nearly strangles him"
havok,raven!
mystique,thats not my name. [before raven kills stryker alex uses his power to release a plasma blast at stryker who gets knocked out] i had that.
havok,i know.
mystique,"lets move out. come on, lets go."
havok,wheres erik?
mystique,im on my own now.
narrator,as they walk out of the tent raven has disguised herself by turning into sanders again
soldier,lets go! move it!
colonel,[raven disguised as sanders guides the mutant soldiers towards a plane which is about to take off] hold that plane! [to the soldiers boarding the plane] wouldnt wanna leave these boys in this god for saken country.
soldier,"yes, sir."
havok,"youre not coming with us, are you?"
colonel,my wars not over. the enemy is still out there.
stryker,"[as alex boards the plane, sanders starts walking away and then transforms into raven dressed in military clothes, at the same time stryker walks out of the tent to look for them] where did they go? [to the mp guards] the four privates, where did they go?"
soldier,they were headed towards the tarmac.
narrator,stryker heads towards the tarmac and watches in frustration as the plane takes off
narrator,"wolverine arrives at the x-mansion which looks abandoned and run down, he notices the sign for xavier school fallen on the ground, he drives to the front door, gets out of his car and knocks on the front door which is opened by hank mccoy / beast"
hank,can i help you?
past wolverine,"uh... yeah, what happened to the school?"
hank,the schools been shut for years. are you a parent? past wolverine:[scoffs] i sure as hell hope not. who are you?
hank,im hank. hank mccoy. i look after the house now.
past wolverine,[smiles] youre beast? look at you. i guess youre a late bloomer.
hank,"i dont know what youre talking about, but im gonna ask you to leave. [tries to shut the door]"
past wolverine,[pushes against door] so wheres the professor?
hank,theres no professor here.
past wolverine,[as logan keeps pushing against the door and hank pushes back to close it] youre pretty strong for a scrawny kid. you sure theres not a little beast in there?
hank,"[struggling] no, hes not here."
past wolverine,"come on, beast. come on, beastie."
hank,no. [gives way as logan bursts through door] [logan finally manages to push through the door and enter the house] [as logan pushes past hank and enters x-mansion] hey! is said the schools closed. you need to leave.
past wolverine,not until i see the professor.
hank,"[hank grabs logan by his shoulder and turns him round] theres no professor here, i told you that."
past wolverine,"[to hank] look, kid. you and i gonna be good friends... [suddenly logan punches hank in the face making him fall to the ground] [hank watches in pain as logan goes to search for the professor] professor! [hank looking angry, hank turns into his beast form] [logan walks through a corridor] professor!"
beast,(roars)
narrator,"suddenly hank in his beat form attacks logan and throws him down the stairs, he hangs on the chandelier ready to strike logan when they are interrupted by young charles xavier"
young charles,hank? whats going on here?
narrator,"logan watches as charles walks down the stairs, wearing his dressing gown and looking disheveled"
past wolverine,professor?
young charles,please dont call me that.
beast,why? you know this guy?
young charles,"yeah, he looks sightly familiar. get off the bloody chandelier, hank."
narrator,hank dismounts from the chandelier
past wolverine,you can walk?
young charles,youre a perceptive one.
past wolverine,i thought erik...
young charles,"which makes it slightly perplexing that you missed our sign on the way in. this is private property, my friend. im gonna have to ask him to ask you to leave."
past wolverine,well. im afraid i cant do that... because i was sent here for you.
young charles,"well, tell whoever it was sent you that im busy."
past wolverine,thats gonna be a little tricky... because the person who sent me was you.
young charles,what?
past wolverine,about 50 years from now.
young charles,"like in the future, 50 years from now?"
past wolverine,yeah.
young charles,i sent you from the future?
past wolverine,yeah.
young charles,piss off.
past wolverine,"if you had powers, youd know i was telling the truth."
young charles,how do you know i dont have p... who are you?
past wolverine,i told you.
young charles,are you cia?
past wolverine,no.
young charles,youve been watching me?
past wolverine,"i know you, charles. weve been friends for years. i know your powers came when you were 9. i know you thought you were going crazy when it started... all the voices in your head. and it wasnt until you were 12... that you realized all the voices were in everyone elses head. do you want me to go on?"
narrator,charles looks confused and shocked
young charles,i never told anyone that.
past wolverine,"no, yet, no, but, you will."
young charles,"all right, youve piqued my interest. what do you want?"
past wolverine,we have to stop raven. i need your help. we need your help.
young charles,[emotional] i think id like to wake up now. [walks away]
narrator,charles walks turns and walks into the next room
hank,[to logan] what does she have to do with this?
narrator,logan watches as hank turns back into his human form
young charles,"so youre saying... they took ravens power, and what? they weaponized it?"
past wolverine,yep.
hank,she is unique.
young charles,"yeah, she is, hank."
past wolverine,"in the beginning the sentinels were just targeting mutants, then they began to identify the genetics in non-mutants whod eventually have mutant children or grandchildren. then they started targeting everybody. many of the humans tried to help us, it was a slaughter. leaving only the worst of humanity in charge. ive been in a lot of wars, ive never seen anything like this. and it all starts with her."
young charles,"lets just say for the sake of... the sake, that i choose to believe you... that i choose to help you. raven wont listen to me. her heat and soul belong to someone else now."
past wolverine,"i know. thats why were gonna need magneto, too."
young charles,erik?
hank,you do know where erik is?
past wolverine,yeah.
narrator,charles laughs harder then starts to walk out of the room
young charles,hes where he belongs.
past wolverine,youre just gonna walk out?
young charles,"ooh, top marks. like i said, you are perceptive."
past wolverine,the professor i know would never turn his back... on someone whod lost their path. especially someone he loved.
narrator,logan angrily grabs hold of charles
past wolverine,"listen to me, you little shit. ive come a long way, and ive watched a lot of people die. good people. friends. if youre gonna wallow in self-pity... and do nothing, then youre gonna watch the same thing... you understand?"
narrator,logan lets go of charles
young charles,we all have to die sometime.
narrator,charles turns and walks off and goes back up stairs to his room
hank,told you theres no professor here.
past wolverine,what the hell happened to him?
hank,"he lost everything. erik, raven... his legs. we built this school, the labs, this whole place... then, just after the first semester... the war in vietnam got worse. many of the teachers... and older students were drafted. it broke him. he retreated himself. i wanted to help, do something... so i designed a serum to treat his spine... derived from the same formula that helps me control my mutation. i take just enough to keep myself balanced... but he takes too much. i tried easing him back... but he just couldnt bear the pain, the voices. the treatment gives him his legs... but its not enough. hes... hes just lost too much."
narrator,"in his room, after hes taken another shot of hanks serum, charles has flashback to when he first met raven when they were children"
young raven,youre not scared of me?
young charles,i always believed i couldnt be the only one in the world. charles xavier.
young raven,raven.
young charles,youre hungry and alone. take whatever you want. weve got lots of food. you dont have to steal. in fact... you never have to steal again. and thats a promise.
narrator,charles joins hank and logan again
young charles,"ill help you get her. not for any of your future shite, but for her."
past wolverine,fair enough.
young charles,but ill tell you this. you dont know erik. that man is a monster. a murderer. you think you can convice raven to change? to come home? thats splendid. but what makes you thibk you can change him?
past wolverine,because you and erik sent me back together.
narrator,we see erik being held in a prison cell beneath the pentagon
hank,the room theyre holding him in was built during the second world war... when there was a shortage of steel. so the foundation is pure concrete and sand. no metal.
young charles,hes being held... a hundred floors beneath the most heavily guarded building the planet.
past wolverine,why is he in there?
young charles,"what, he forgot to mention?"
hank,"uh, jfk."
past wolverine,he killed...
young charles,what else explains a bullet miraculously curving through the air? eriks always had a way with guns. are you sure you want to carry on with this?
young charles,"this is your plan, not mine."
hank,we dont have any resources to get us in.
young charles,or out. its just me and hank.
past wolverine,"i know a guy. yeah, hed be a young man now. grew up outside of d.c. he could get into anywhere. i just dont know how the hell were gonna find him."
narrator,hank looks at charles
hank,is cerebro of the question? [charles looks down] we have a phonebook.
narrator,in the evening at trask industries trask walks through to get to his office
sectary,"i thought youd be getting ready for your trip, sir?"
dr. trask,i just came to grab a couple files. is that a new scarf? its nice.
sectary,thank you. dr. trask?
narrator,"as trask walks up the stairs we see him transform in to raven, she starts looking through his desk drawers but finds nothing, she notices a large painting of trask behind his desk and finds a hidden safe under it, she manages to gain access and enters to find his personal files, including blueprints for the sentinels, as well as autopsy reports on the mutants hes experimented on including her former friends azazel and angel salvadore, as tears roll down her face trasks secretary suddenly comes into trasks office"
mystique,[speaking in trasks voice] once second.
narrator,mystique now transformed into trask again steps out of the safe
sectary,[she hands him a piece of paper] oh. we added some names to the paris meeting.
dr. trask,thank you. [she looks at trask and notices the tear rolling down his face]
sectary,"is something wrong, sir?"
dr. trask,"[trask quickly wipes the tear from his face]no. its nothing. [trask quickly wipes the tear from his face] would you mind trying up my itinerary? i dont wanna miss anything. [his secretary nods her head, turns and walks off]"
narrator,"logan, charles and hank drive up to peter maximoff/quicksilvers home, a mutant with superhuman speed"
past wolverine,"here, here, here."
young charles,where?
past wolverine,just stop here.
young charles,"all right, all right."
past wolverine,next time im driving.
young charles,dont get used to it.
narrator,"they get of the car and walk over to the front door, logan knocks on the door and his mother answers the door"
ms. maximoff,whats he done now? i just write you a check for whatever he took.
past wolverine,we just need to talk to him.
narrator,she lets them enter
ms. maximoff,peter! the cops are here. again.
narrator,the three walk down to the basement where peter is playing table tennis with himself using his powers of speed
quicksilver,what do you guys want? i didnt do anything. [suddenly he sits down on the couch] ive been here all day.
past wolverine,"just relax, peter. were not cops."
quicksilver,"of course youre not. if you were, you wouldnt be driving a rental car."
young charles,how did you know weve got a rental car?
quicksilver,"i checked your registration when you were walking to the door. i also had some time to kill so i went through your rental agreement. saw you were from out of town. are you fbi? [using his power he quickly swipes charles wallet and looks at charles card] no, youre not cops. hey, whats with his gifted youngsters place? [he drops the card and wallet to the floor]"
young charles,thats an old card.
hank,hes fascinating.
young charles,hes a pain in the arise.
hank,"what, a teleporter?"
past wolverine,"no, he just fast. and when i knew him he wasnt so... young."
