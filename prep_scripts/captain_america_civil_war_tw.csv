Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier,"""No! No!"""
Vasily Karpov,"Longing. Rusted. Seventeen. Daybreak. Furnace. Nine. Benign. Home coming. One. Freight car. Good morning, soldier."
Bucky Barnes,Ready to comply.
Vasily Karpov,"I have a mission for you. Sanction and extract No witnesses. Well done, soldier."
LAGOS ,PRESENT DAY:
Steve,"Alright, what do you see?"
Wanda,Standard beat cops. Small station. Quiet street. Its a good target.
Steve,"Theres an ATM in the south corner, which means..."
Wanda,Cameras.
Steve,Both cross streets one way?
Wanda,So compromise the escape routes.
Steve,Means our guy doesnt care about being seen he isnt afraid to make a mess on the way out. You see that ranger over half way up the block.
Wanda,You mean the red one. Its cute.
Natasha,"Its also bullet proof, which means private security, which means more guns, which means more headaches for somebody, probably us."
Wanda,"You guys know I can move things with my mind, right?"
Natasha,Looking over your shoulder needs to become a second nature.
Sam,"Anybody ever tell you, youre a little paranoid."
Natasha,"Not to my face. Why, did you hear something?"
Steve,"Eyes on target, folks. Its the best lead we have on Rumlow in 6 months. I dont want to lose him."
Sam,"If he sees us coming there wont be a problem, he kind of hate us."
Steve,"Sam, see that garbage truck? Take it."
Sam,"Give me X-ray. Max capacity The trucks loaded for max weight, and the drivers armed."
Natasha,Its a battling ram.
Steve,Go now.
Wanda,Why?
Steve, Hes not aiming the police. INSTITUTE FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES
Steve,Body armor. AR15s I make 7 hostiles.
Sam,I make 5.
Wanda,Sam.
Sam,Four. Rumlows on the third floor.
Steve,Wanda. Just like we practice.
Wanda,What about the gas?
Steve,Get it out.
Rumlow,Pack it up. Hes here.
Steve,Rumlow has a biological weapon.
Natasha,Im on it.
Rumlow,I dont work like that no more. Fire in the hole.
Sam,Hes in the main humvee heading north.
Rumlow,Take this to the extract. Were not going to out run him. Lose the truck.
Bad Guy #1, Where are you going to meet us?
Rumlow, Im not.
Sam,"I got 4, theyre splitting up."
Natasha,I got the two on the left.
Steve,They ditch their gear. Its a shell game now. One of them has the payload.
Rumlow,"There you are, you son of a bitch. Ive been waiting for this!"
Sam,He doesnt have it. Im empty.
Natasha,Out of the way! Look out!
Bad Guy #1,Drop it. Or Ill drop this. Drop it!
Bad Guy #2,Hell do it!
Natasha,"Payload secured. Thanks, Sam."
Sam,Dont thank me.
Natasha,Im not thanking that thing.
Sam,His name is Redwing.
Natasha,Im still not thanking it.
Sam,"Hes cute. Come on, pet em. Rumlow: This is for dropping a building on my face. I think it look pretty good, all things considered."
Steve,Whos your buyer?
Rumlow,"He knew we knew you. You pal, your buddy, your Bucky."
Steve,What did you say?
Rumlow,"He remembered you. I was there. He got all weepy about it. Till they put put his brain back in the blender. He wanted you to know something. He said to me, ""Please tell Rogers,"" ""When you got to go, you got to go. "" And youre coming with me."
Steve,"Oh my... Sam. We need... Fire and rescue, on the south side of the building. We got to get up here."
Maria Stark,"Try to remember the kind of September. When grass was green... Wake up, dear. Say goodbye to your father."
Howard Stark,Whos the homeless person on the couch?
Young Tony,This is why I love coming home for Christmas. Right before you leave town.
Maria,"Be nice, dear. Hes been studying abroad."
Howard,"Really, which broad? Whats her name?"
Tony,Candice.
Howard,Do me a favour. Try not to burn the house down before Monday.
Tony,"Okay, so its Monday. That is good to know. I will plan my toker party accordingly. Wherere you going?"
Maria,You fathers flying us to the Bahamas for a little get away.
Howard,We might have to make a quick stop.
Tony,At the Pentagon. Right? Dont worry. Youre going to love the holiday menu at the commissure.
Howard,"You know, they say sarcasm is a metric for potential. If thats true, youll be a great man some day. Ill get the bags."
Maria,"He does miss you when you are not here. And frankly, youre going to miss us. Because this is the last time were all going to be together. You know whats about to happen. Say something. If you dont, youll regret it."
Tony,"I love you, Dad. And I knew you did the best you could. Thats how I wished it happened. By merely augmented retro framing or ""BARF"". God, I got to work on that acronym. An extremely costly method, of hijacking the hippocampus to clear... traumatic memories. It doesnt change the fact that they never made it to the airport, or the things I did to avoid processing my grief. Plus, 611 million dollars for my little therapeutic experiment. No one in the right mind would ever funded it. Help me out. Whats the MIT admission statement. To generate, disseminate and preserve knowledge, and work with others, to bring to bear on the worlds great challenges. Well, you, or the others. And quite as it kept the challenges facing you are the greatest mankind has ever known. Plus, most of you are broke. also, I rather you work. As of this moment, every student has been made an equal recipient of the Inaugural September Foundation Grant. As in, all of your projects have just been approved and funded. No strings. No taxes. Just... reframe the future. Starting now. Go break some eggs."
Teacher Man,"That uh... That took my breathe away. Tony, so generous, so much money. Wow! I... Out of curiosity and... Will any portion of that grant be made available to faculty? I know, gross, but hear me out. I have got this killer idea for a self cooking hotdog. Basically, chemical detonator embedded..."
Tony,"The Restroom this way, yeah?"
Teacher Man,Yeah. Embedding in the meat shaft.
Woman,"Mr. Stark, I am so sorry about the telepromter. I didnt know Miss Potts has canceled. They didnt have time to fix it."
Tony,Its... fine. Ill be right back.
Teacher Man,Well catch up later.
Mrs. Spencer,"That was really sweet, what you did for the young people."
Tony,"Oh, they deserve it. Cos it helps to ease my conscious."
Mrs. Spencer,"They say, theres a correlation between generosity and guilt. But, you got the money. Break as many eggs as you like. Its brilliant."
Tony,Are you going up?
Mrs. Spencer,Im right where I wanted to be.
Tony,"Okay, okay. Hey! Im sorry. Its my occupation hazard."
Mrs. Spencer,"I work for the State department. Human resources. I know its boring. But, it enabled me to raise a son. Im very proud of what he grew up to be. His name was Charlie Spencer. Your murdered him. In Sokovia. Not that it matters in the least to you. You think you fight for us. You just fight for yourself. Whos going to avenge my son, Stark? Hes dead. And I blame you."
Reporter,"11 Wakandans were among those killed during a confrontation between the Avengers and a group of mercenaries in Lagos, Nigeria, last month. The traditionally reclusive Wakandans were on an outreach mission in Lagos when the attack occurred."
King TChaka,"Our peoples blood is spilled on foreign soil. Not only the cause of the actions are criminals, but by the indifference of those pledge to stop them. Victory at the expense of the innocent, is no victory at all."
Reporter,The Wakanda king went on to... What legal authority does an enhanced individual like Wanda Maximoff have to operate in Nigeria?
Wanda,Its my fault.
Steve,Thats not true.
Wanda,"Turn the TV back on, theyre being very specific."
Steve,"I shouldve grabbed that bomb as Im the leader to deal with it. Rumlow said Bucky and... All of a sudden, I was a 16 year old kid again in Brooklyn. People died."
Wanda,Its on me.
Steve,"Its on both of us. This job... We try to save as many people as we can. Sometimes that doesnt mean everybody, but, we cant find a way to live with that, Next time... maybe nobody can be saved."
Wanda,"Vis, we talked about this."
Vision,Yes. But the door was opened so I assumed... Captain Rogers wished to know when Mr. Stark was arriving.
Steve,Thank you. Ill be right down.
Vision,"Ill... use the door. Oh, and apparently, hes brought a guest."
Steve,You know who it is?
Vision,The secretary of State.
Natasha,"And what word would you use, Mr. Secretary."
Secretary Ross,"How about ""Dangerous?"" What would you call a group of US-based, enhanced individuals, who routinely ignores sovereign borders and inflict their will wherever they choose and who, frankly, seem unconcerned about what they leave behind them. New York. Washington DC. Sokovia. Lagos."
Steve,Okay. Thats enough.
Secretary Ross,"For the past 4 years, you operated with unlimited power and no supervision. Thats an arrangement the governments of the world can no longer tolerate. But I think we have a solution. The Sokovia accords. Approved by 117 countries. It states, that the Avengers shall no longer be a private organization. Instead, theyll operate under the supervision of a United Nations Panel, only when and if that Panel deems it necessary."
Steve,The Avengers were formed to make the world a safer place. I feel weve done that.
Secretary Ross,"Tell me captain, do you know where Thor and Banner are right now? If I misplaced a couple of 30 mega tonne nukes, you can bet thered be consequences Compromise. Reassurance. Thats how the world works. Believe me, this is the middle ground."
Rhodey,"So, there are contingencies? "
Secretary Ross,"3 days from now, the UN meets in Vienna to ratify the Accords. So, talk it over."
Natasha,And if we come to a decision you dont like?
Secretary Ross,Then you retire. CLEVELAND
Zemo,"Hello? Is this your car out front? I jumped the curb. Maybe we could, take care of it ourselves. If you prefer to call the cops, then, thats okay too, I guess."
Vasily Karpov,No. No cops.
Vasily Karpov,Who are you?
Zemo,"My name is Zemo. I will repeat my question. Mission report. December 16, 1991"
Vasily Karpov,How did you find me?
Zemo,"When SHIELD fell, Black Widow released HYDRA files to the public. Millions of pages much of it encrypted, not easy to decipher. But, I have experience. And patience. A man can do anything if he has those."
Vasily Karpov,What do you want?
Zemo,"Mission report. December 16, 1991"
Vasily Karpov,Go to hell.
Zemo,"HYDRA deserves its place on the ashtray, so your death would not bother me. But I have to use this book, and other bloodier methods to find what I need. I dont look forward to that. You know, maybe youre dying for... your pride."
Vasily Karpov,"Hail, HYDRA."
Rhodey,Secretary Ross has a Congressional Medal of Honor which is one more than you have.
Sam Wilson,"So, lets say we agree to this thing. How long is it gonna be before they lo-jack us like a bunch of common criminals?"
Rhodey,"A 117 countries want to sign this. 117, Sam, and youre just like, ""No, its cool. """
Sam,How long are you going to play both sides?
Vision,I have an equation.
Sam,"Oh, this will clear it up."
Vision,"In the 8 years since Mr. Stark announced himself as Iron Man, the number of noted enhanced persons has grown exponentially. And during the same period, the number of potentially world-ending events has risen at a commissive rate."
Steve,Are you saying its our fault?
Vision,Im saying there maybe a causality. Our very strength invites challenge. Challenge incites conflict. And conflict... breeds catastrophe. Oversight. Oversight is not an idea that could be dismissed out-of-hand.
Rhodey,Boom.
Natasha,"Tony, youre being uncharacteristically non-hyper verbal."
Steve,Thats because hes already made up his mind.
Tony,"Boy, you know me so well. Actually, Im nursing my electromagnetic headache. Thats whats going on, Cap. Its just pain... says Humphrey. Whos putting coffee grounds in the disposal? Am I running a bed and breakfast for a biker gang? Oh, thats Charles Spencer by the way. Hes a great kid. Computer engineering degree. 3.6 GPA. Had a floor level gig. An Intel plan for the fall. But first, he wanted to put a few miles on his soul. Before he park it behind then desk. See the world, maybe be of service. Charlie didnt want to go to Vegas which is what I would do. He didnt go to Paris or Amsterdam. Sounds fun. He decided to spend his summer, building sustainable housing for the poor. Guess where, Sokovia. He want to make a difference, I suppose. I mean, we wont know because we dropped a building on him while we were kicking ass. Theres no decision making process here. We need to be put in check. Whatever form that takes, Im game. If we cant accept limitations, were bounderless, were no better than the bad guys."
Steve,"Tony, if someone dies on your watch, you dont give up."
Tony,Who said were giving up?
Steve,"We are, for not taking responsibility for our actions. These documents just shifts the blames."
Rhodey,"Sorry. Steve, that... That is dangerously arrogant. This is the United Nations were talking about. Its not the world security council, its not SHIELD, its not HYDRA."
Steve,"No, but its run by people with agendas and agendas change."
Tony,"Thats good. Thats why Im here. When I realized what my weapons were capable of in the wrong hands, I shut it down and stop manufacturing them."
Steve,"Tony. You chose to do that. If we sign these, we surrender our right to choose. What if this Panel sends us somewhere we dont think we should go. What if its somewhere we need to go, and they dont let us. We may not be perfect, but the safest hands are still our own."
Tony,"If we dont do this now, its going to be done to us later. Thats a fact. That wont be pretty."
Wanda,Youre saying they will come for me.
Vision,We will protect you.
Natasha,"Maybe Tony is right. If, we have one hand on the wheel that can still steer."
Sam,Arent you the same woman who told the government to kiss our ass a few years ago.
Natasha,Im just... playing the field. We have made some very public mistakes. We need to win our trust back.
Tony,"Im sorry, did I just mishear you or did you agree with me."
Natasha,"Oh, I want to take it back."
Tony,"No, no, no. You cant retract it. Thank you. Im impress by what you did. Okay, case close. - I win."
Text Message,Shes gone. In her sleep.
Steve,"I have to go. LONDON MARGARET ""PEGGY"" CARTER"
Preacher,"And now, I would like to invite Sharon Carter, to come up and say a few words."
Sharon Carter,"Margaret Carter was known to most as a founder of SHIELD. But I just knew her as Aunt Peggy. She had a photograph in her office. Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK. As a kid, that was pretty cool. But, it was a lot to live up to. Which is why I never told anyone we were related. I asked her once how she managed to master diplomacy and espionage at a time when no one wanted to see a woman succeed at either. And she said, compromise when you can. When you cant, dont. Even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right. Even if the whole world is telling you to move. It is your duty, to plant yourself like a tree, look them in they eye and say, "" No... ...you move. Steve:When I came out of the ice, thought I wanted to ignore she was gone. When I found out that she was alive, I was just lucky to have her."
Natasha,Shed had youre back too.
Steve,Who else sign it.
Natasha,"Tony, Rhodey, Vision."
Steve,Clint?
Natasha,Says hes retired.
Steve,Wanda?
Natasha,TBD. (To Be Determined) Im off to Vienna for the signing of the Accords. There is plenty of room on the jet. Just because its the path of least resistance does mean its the wrong path. Staying together is more important than how we stay together. What are we giving up to do it?
Steve,"Sorry, Nat. I cant sign it."
Natasha,I know.
Steve,"Well, then. What are you doing here?"
Natasha,I didnt want you to be alone. Come here. VIENNA
Reporter,"At a specially United Nations congress, 117 countries have come together to ratify Sokovia Accords."
Receptionist,"Excuse me, Miss Romanoff?"
Natasha,Yes?
Receptionist,I just need your signature. <nowiki> </nowiki>Thank you.
Natasha,Thanks.
TChalla,I suppose neither of us is used to the spot light.
Natasha,Well. Its not always so flattering.
TChalla,You seem to be doing alright so far. Considering your last trip to Capitol Hill. I wouldnt think you would be particularly comfortable in this company.
Natasha,"Well, Im not."
TChalla,"That alone, makes me glad youre here, Miss Romanoff."
Natasha,Why? You dont approve of all this?
TChalla,"The Accords, yes. The politics, not really. Two people, in a room, can get more done than a 100."
TChaka,Unless you need to move a piano.
TChalla,Father.
TChaka,Son. Miss. Romanoff.
Natasha,"King TChaka. Please, allow me to apologize for what happened in Nigeria."
TChaka,Thank you. Thank you for agreeing to all this. Im sad to hear that Captain Rogers will not be joining us today.
Natasha,"Yes, so am I."
Guy on PA system,"Everyone, please be seated. This assembly is now in session."
TChaka,That is the future calling. Such a pleasure.
Natasha,Thank you.
TChaka,"For a man who disapproves of diplomacy, youre getting quite good at it."
TChalla,"Im happy, Father."
TChaka,Thank you.
TChalla,Thank you.
TChaka,"When stolen Wakandan vibranium was used to make a terrible weapon, we, in Wakanda, were forced to question our legacy. Those men and women killed in Nigeria, were part of a goodwill mission from a country too long in the shadows. We will not, however, let misfortune drive us back. We will fight to improve the world we wish to join. I am grateful to the Avengers for supporting this initiative. Wakanda is proud to extend its hand in peace."
TChalla,EVERYBODY GET DOWN!
Sharon,"My mom tried to talk me on enlisting, but... not aunt Peggy. She brought me my first knife holster. - Very practical. - And stylish."
Steve,CIA has you stationed over here now?
Sharon,"In Berlin, joint terrorist and task force."
Steve,Right. - Sounds fun.
Sharon,"I know, right?"
Steve,Ive been meaning to ask you. When you were spying on me from across the hall...
Sharon,You mean when I was doing my job?
Steve,Did Peggy know?
Sharon,She kept so many secrets. I didnt want her to have to remember you. - Thanks for walking me back.
Steve,Sure.
Sam,Steve. Theres something you got to see.
Reporter,A bomb hidden in a news van
Reporter,...blast through the UN building in Vienna.
Steve,Whos coordinating?
Reporter,"More than 70 people have been injured. At least 12 are dead. Including Wakandas King TChaka. Officials have released a video of a suspect, identified as James Buchanan Barnes, the Winter soldier. The infamous HYDRA agent, linked to numerous acts of terrorism and political assassinations."
Sharon,I have to go to work.
Natasha,Im very sorry.
TChalla,"In my culture, death, is not the end. Its more of a... stepping off point. You reach out with both hands and bask... in segment. They lead you into the green valley where... you can run forever."
Natasha,That sounds very peaceful.
TChalla,My father thought so. I am not my father.
Natasha,TChalla. Task force will decide who brings in Barnes.
TChalla,"Dont bother, Miss. Romanoff. Ill kill him myself."
Natasha,Yeah?
Steve,Are you alright?
Natasha,"Ah, yeah, thanks. I got lucky. I know how much Barnes mean to you. I really do. Stay at home. Youll only make this worse for all of us. Please."
Steve,Are you saying youll arrest me?
Natasha,"No. Someone will, if you interfere. Thats how it works now. If hes gone this far gone, then..."
Steve,I should be the one to bring him in.
Natasha,Why?
Steve,Because Im the one least likely to die trying.
Natasha,Shit.
Sam,Did she tell you to stay out of it? - Might have a point.
Steve,Hed do it for me.
Sam,"1945, maybe. I just want to make sure we considered all our options. The people that shoot at you, usually wind up shooting at me."
Sharon,"Tips have been pouring in since the footage went public. Everybody thinks the Winter soldier goes to their gym. Most of it is noise, except for this. My boss expects a briefing and he pretty much knows, so... thats all the answer youre going to get."
Steve,Thank you.
Sharon,And youre going to have to hurry. We have orders to shoot on sight.
Room Service Lady,Mr. Muller I brought breakfast.
Zemo,I could smell it before opening the door. Thank you.
Room Service Lady,"Bacon and black coffee. Again. I can fix you something different, if you like."
Zemo,Its okay. This is wonderful.
Room Service Lady,Ill put this in the...
Zemo,"No, no, no. Ill do it. Ill do it. Dont worry. BUCHARES"
Sam,"Heads up, Cap. German special forces approaching from the south."
Steve,Understood. Do you know me?
Bucky,Youre Steve. I read about you at the museum.
Sam,Theyve set the perimeter.
Steve,I know youre nervous. And you have plenty of reason to be. But youre lying.
Bucky,I wasnt in Vienna. I dont do that anymore.
Sam,Theyre entering the building.
Steve,"Well, the people who think you did are coming here now. And theyre not planning on taking you alive."
Bucky,Thats smart. Good strategy.
Sam,Theyre on the roof. Im compromised.
Bucky,"This doesnt have end in a fight, Buck."
Bucky,It always ends in a fight.
Sam,5 seconds. You pulled me from the river. Why?
Bucky,I dont know.
Sam,3 seconds!
Steve,"Yes, you do."
Sam,Breach! Breach! Breach!
Steve,"Buck, stop! Youre gonna kill someone."
Bucky,Im not gonna kill anyone.
Cop,The suspect has escaped. Get him! Come on.
Steve,"Sam, south. West rooftop."
Sam,Who the hell is the other guy?
Steve,Im about to find out. - Sam.
Sam,Got it.
Cop,Stand down! Stand down!
Steve,"Sam, I cant shake this guy."
Sam,Right behind you.
Rhodes,"Stand down. Now. Congratulations, Captain. Youre a criminal. Your highness."
Vision,A pinch of paprika. A pinch.
Wanda,Is that Paprikash?
Vision,I thought it might... lift your spirits.
Wanda,Spirits lifted.
Vision,"In my defense, I havent actually... - eaten anything before, so... - Aye, aye. Please. - Wanda."
Wanda,Hmm.
Vision,"No one dislikes you, Wanda."
Wanda,Thanks.
Vision,"Oh, youre welcome. No. Its a... involuntary response in their amygdala they cant help but be afraid of you."
Wanda,Are you?
Vision,"My amygdala is synthetic, so..."
Wanda,"I used to think of myself one way. But, after this. I am something else. And still me, I think. But... thats not what everyone else sees."
Vision,"Do you know, I dont know what this is. Not really. I know its not of this world. But it powered Loki staff, gave you your abilities. But... its true nature is a mystery. And yet, it is part of me. Are you afraid of it? I wish to understand it. The more I do, the less it controls me. One day, who knows, I may even control it."
Wanda,"I dont know whats in this but it is not paprika. Im gonna go to the store, Ill be back in 20 minutes. Alternatively, we could order a pizza? Vision, are you not letting me leave?"
Vision,Its a question of safety. - I can protect myself. Not yours. Mr. Stark would like to avoid the possibility of another public incident. Until the Accords are a... more secured foundation.
Wanda,And what do you want?
Vision,For people to see you... as I do. BERLIN
Sam,"So, you like cats?"
Steve,Sam.
Sam,What? Dude shows up dressed like a cat and you dont wanna know more?
Steve,Your suit. Is it Vibranium?
TChalla,"The Black Panther has been the protector of Wakanda for generations. A mantle passed from warrior to warrior. And now because your friend murdered my father, I also wear the mantle of king. So I ask you, as both warrior and king, how long do you think you can keep your friend safe from me?"
Steve,Whats going to happen?
Everett Ross,The same thing that ought to happen to you. Psychological evaluation and extradition.
Sharon,"This is Everett Ross, deputy task force commander."
Steve,What about our lawyer.
Everett Ross,"Lawyer, thats funny. See to their weapons are placed in the lock up. Oh, well write you a receipt."
Sam,I better not look out the window and see anybody flying around in that.
Everett Ross,"You will be provided with an office instead of a cell. And do me a favour, stay in it."
TChalla,Im not intending on going anywhere.
Natasha,For the record. This is what making things worse looks like.
Steve,Hes alive.
Natasha,"The remaining of us are now at court-sec. And, Colonel Ross is supervising the clean up. Try not to break anything while we fix this."
Tony,"Consequences? You bet there will be consequences. Obviously you can quote me on that because I just said it. Anything else? Thank you, sir."
Steve,Consequences?
Tony,Secretary Ross wants you both prosecuted. I have to give him something.
Steve,"Im not getting that shield back, am I?"
Natasha,"Technically, its the governments property. - Wings too."
Sam,Thats cold.
Natasha,Warmer than jail.
Tony,"Hey, you want to see something cool? I pulled something from dads archives. Well, timely. FDR signed the Land-Lease bills with these in 1941. Provided support to the allies when they needed most. Someone said it brought our country closer to war. Seen enough of these, you wouldnt be here. Im trying to, what do you call it? a... an alfermage. Is that what you call it?"
Steve,Is Pepper here? I didnt see her.
Tony,We are... kinda... - well not kinda...
Steve,Pregnant?
Tony,"No, definitely not. Were taking a break. Its nobodys fault."
Steve,"So sorry, Tony. I didnt know."
Tony,"Few years ago, I almost lost her, so I trashed all my suits. Then, we had to muck up HYDRA. And then Ultron, my fault. And then, and then, and then. I never stopped. Cause the truth is I dont wanna stop. I dont want to lose her. I thought maybe the Accords can split the difference. In her defense, Im her handful. Yet, dad was a pain in the ass, but he and mom always made it work."
Steve,"You know, Im glad Howard got married. I only knew him when he was young and single."
Tony,"Oh really? You two knew each other? He never mentioned that. Maybe only a thousand times. God, I hated you."
Steve,I dont mean to make things difficult.
Tony,I know. Because youre a very polite person.
Steve,"If I see a situation pointed south, I cant ignore it. - Sometimes I wish I could."
Tony,"No, you dont. Sometimes... Sometimes I wanna punch you in your perfect teeth. But I dont wanna see you gone. We need you, Cap. Until further nothings happen that cant be undone, please... sign. We can make the last 24 hours legit. Barnes gets transferred to an American psych center instead of a Wakanda prison. Im not saying its impossible. But there would have to be safeguards Sure. Once we put out the PR fire, these documents can be amended. I filed a motion to have you and Wanda reinstated."
Steve,Wanda? What about Wanda?
Tony,Shes fine. Shes confined to the compound currently. Visions keeping her company.
Steve,"Oh God, Tony! Every time. Every time I think youre seeing things the right way..."
Tony,What? Its a 100 acres with a lap pool. Its got a screening room. Theres worse ways to protect people.
Steve,"Protection? Is that how you see this? This is protection? Its internment, Tony."
Tony,Shes not a US Citizen.
Steve,"Oh, come on, Tony."
Tony,And they dont grant visas to Weapons of Mass Destruction.
Steve,Shes a kid!
Tony,GIVE ME A BREAK! Im doing what has to be done ...to save us something worse.
Steve,You keep telling yourself that. Hate to break up the set.
Zemo,"Hello, Mr. Barnes. Ive been sent by the United Nations to evaluate you. Do you mind if I sit? Your first name is James?"
Sharon,The receipt for your gear.
Sam,Bird costume?
Sharon,Come on. I didnt write it.
Zemo,"Im not here to judge you. I just want to ask you a few questions. Do you know where you are, James? I cant help you if you dont talk to me, James."
Bucky,My name is Bucky.
Delivery,Hello?
Man,Hey.
Delivery Man,Okay. Here. Just sign here.
Man,Here?
Delivery Man,Yeah.
Steve,Why would the task force release this photo to begin with?
Sharon,"Get the word out, involve as many eyes as we can?"
Steve,"Right. Its a good way to flush a guy out of hiding. Set off a bomb, get your picture taken."
Sharon,It got 7 million people looking for the Winter soldier.
Steve,Youre saying someone framed him to find him.
Sam,"Steve, we looked for the guy for 2 years and found nothing."
Steve,He didnt bomb the UN. That turns a lot of heads.
Sharon,So? That doesnt guarantee that whoever framed him would get him a guarantees that we would.
Steve,Yeah.
Zemo,"Tell me Bucky. Youve seen a great deal, havent you?"
Bucky,I dont want to talk about it.
Zemo,"You feel that... if you open your mouth, the horrors might never stop. Dont worry."
MESSAGE INBOX,1
STATUS,PACKAGE DELIVERED
Zemo,We only have to talk about one.
Man,Hey. What is this?
Everett Ross,"Great. Come on, guys. Get me eyes on Barnes."
Sharon,Go.
Tony,FRIDAY. Give me the source of that damage.
FRIDAY,"Sub-level 5, east wing."
Bucky,What the hell is this?
Zemo,"Why dont we discuss your home? Not Romania. Certainly not Brooklyn, no. I mean, your real home. Longing. Rusted."
Bucky,Stop.
Zemo,Seventeen.
Bucky,Stop.
Zemo, Daybreak. Furnace. Nine. Benign. Homecoming One. Freight car. Soldier?
Bucky,Ready to comply.
Zemo,"Mission report. December 16, 1991. Help me. Help?"
Steve,Get up. Who are you? What do you want?
Zemo,To see an empire fall.
Sam,Hey.
Everett Ross,Evac all civilians. Give me a perimeter around the building and gunships in the air.
Natasha,Please tell me you have a suit.
Tony,"Sure do. Its a lovely Tom Ford, three-Piece, 2 button..."
Natasha,"Im on active duty, non combatant Follow me. Were in position. You could at least recognize me."
Sam,Damn it.
Zemos Wife,"He asked me again if youre going to be there? I said I wasnt sure. You shouldve seen his little face. Just try, okay? Im going to bed. I love you."
Reporter,"James Barnes, the suspect in the bombing of the UN in Vienna escaped from prison today Also disappeared are the Avengers, Captain Steve Rogers and Sam Wilson. GATE 6- BERLIN AIRPOR MOSCOW"
Sam,"Hey, Cap!"
Bucky,Steve.
Steve,Which Bucky am I talking to?
Bucky,Your mothers name is Sarah. You used to wear newspapers in your shoes.
Steve,You cant read that in a museum.
Sam,"Just like that, were suppose to be cool?"
Bucky,What did I do?
Steve,Enough.
Bucky,I knew this would happen. Everything HYDRA put inside me is still there. All he had to do is say the god damn words.
Steve,Who was he?
Bucky,I dont know.
Steve," People are dead. The bombing. The set up. The doctor did all that just to get 10 minutes with you. I need you to do better than ""I dont know."""
Bucky,He wanted to know about Siberia. Where I was kept. - He wanted to know exactly where.
Steve,Why would he need to know that?
Bucky,Because Im not the only Winter soldier.
Vasily Karpov,Good job.
Other Winter Soldier,It hurts!
Vasily Karpov,Get me out of here.
Steve,Who were they?
Bucky,The most elite death squad. More kills than anyone in the HYDRA history. - And that was before the serum.
Sam,They all turned out like you?
Bucky,Worse.
Steve,"The doctor, can he control them?"
Bucky,Enough.
Steve,He said he wanted to see an empire fall.
Bucky,"With these guys he can do it. They speak 30 languages, can hide in plain sight, infiltrate, assassinate, destabilize, They can take a whole country down in 1 night. Youd never see them coming."
Sam,This would be a lot easier a week ago.
Steve,If we could... If we call Tony.
Sam,"Oh, he wont believe us."
Steve,Even if he did.
Sam,Who knows if the Accords will let him help.
Steve,Were on our own.
Sam,Maybe not. I know a guy.
Secretary Ross,And I dont suppose you have any idea where they are.
Tony,We will. GSG-9s got the borders covered. Recons flying 24/7. Theyll get a hit. Well handle it.
Secretary Ross,"You dont get it, Stark. Its not yours to handle. Its clear you cant be objective. Im putting special ops on this."
Tony,"And what happens when the shooting starts, let them kill Steve Rogers?"
Secretary Ross,If we are provoked.
Secretary Ross,Barnes would have been eliminated in Romania if it wasnt for Rogers. There are dead people who would be alive now. Feel free to check my math.
Tony,"All due respect, youre not going to solve this with boys in bullet vest. You got to let us bring him in."
Secretary Ross,And how will that end any differently from the last time.
Tony,"Because this time I wont be wearing Loafers and a silk suit. 72 hours, guaranteed."
Secretary Ross,36 hours. Barnes. Rogers. Wilson.
Tony,"Thank you, sir. My left arm is numb, is that normal?"
Natasha,You alright?
Tony,"Always. 36 hours, jeez."
Natasha,Were seriously understaffed.
Tony,"Oh, yeah. It would be great if we have a hulk, right about now. Any shot?"
Natasha,No. You really think hed be on our side?
Tony,I know. - Ive an idea.
Natasha,Me too.
Tony,Whats yours?
Natasha,Downstairs. Whats yours? QUEENS
Peter,"Hey, Aunt May."
Aunt May,Hey. - How was school today?
Peter,Okay. This crazy car parked outside...
Tony,"Oh, Mr. Parker."
Peter,Umm. What. What are you doing...? Hey. Im-Im-Im Peter.
Tony,Tony.
Peter,What are... What are you - What are you - What are you doing here?
Tony,"Its about time we met.  Youve been getting my e-mails, right? - Right?"
Peter,Yeah. Yeah. - Regarding the...
Tony,You didnt tell me about the grant.
Peter,About the grant.
Tony,The September Foundation.
Peter,Right.
Tony,Yeah. Remember when you applied.
Peter,Yeah.
Tony,"I approved. So now, were in business."
Aunt May,You didnt tell me anything. Whats up with that? - Youre keeping secrets from me?
Peter,"Why, I just, I just... I just know how much you love surprises, so I thought I would let you know... wh... - Anyway, what did I apply for?"
Tony,Thats what Im here to hash out.
Peter,"Okay. Hash, hash out, okay."
Tony,"Its so hard for me to believe that shes someones aunt. We come in all shapes and sizes, you know. This walnut bake loaf is exceptional."
Peter,Let me just stop you there.
Tony,"Yeah? Is this grant, like, got money involved or whatever? No?"
Tony,Yeah. - Yeah. - Its pretty well funded. - Wow. Look who youre talking to. - Can I have 5 minutes with him?
Aunt May,Sure.
Tony,"As walnut bake loaves go, that wasnt bad. Oh. What do we have here, retro tech, huh? - Thrift store? Salvation army?"
Peter,"Uh, the garbage actually."
Tony,Youre a dumpster diver.
Peter,"Yeah, I was... Anyway, look. Umm. I definitely did not apply for your grant."
Tony,"Uh,uh. Me first. - Okay. Quick question of the rhetorical variety. Thats you, right?"
Peter,"Um, no. - What do you. What do you..."
Tony,"Yeah. Look at you go. Wow, nice catch! 3000 pounds. 40 miles an hour. Its not easy. You got mad skills."
Peter,Thats all-Thats all on Youtube though right. I mean thats where you found it. Cause you know thats all fake. Its all done on a computer?
Tony,Mm-Hmm.
Peter,Its like that video that records...
Tony,Yea yea yea yea... oh you mean like those UFOs over Phoenix? Exactly! What have we here? Uh... Thats a... So. Youre this... Spider... ling. Crime fighting Spider... Youre Spider-Boy?
Peter,S... Spider-Man.
Tony,"Not in that wanzie, youre not. Its not a wanzie."
Peter,"You wont believe this. I was actually having a real good day today, you know, Mr. Stark. Didnt miss my trains. This perfectly good DVD player was just sitting there and... Algebra test. Nailed it!"
Tony,Who else knows? Anybody?
Peter,Nobody.
Tony,Not even your... unusually attractive Aunt?
Peter,"No. No, no. No, no. If she knew, she would freak out. And when she freaks out, I freak out."
Tony,You know what I think is really cool? This webbing. Tensile strength is off the charts - Who manufactured them?
Peter,I did.
Tony,Climbing the walls.  How are you doing that?
Peter,Cohesive gloves. Its a long story. I was uh...
Tony,Lordy! Can you even see in these?
Peter,"Yes. Yes, I can! I can. I can-I can see in those. Okay? Its just that... when... whatever happened happened, its like my senses have been dialed to 11. Theres way too much input, so... they just kinda help me focus."
Tony,"Youre in dire need of an upgrade. Systemic, top to bottom. 100-point restoration. Thats why Im here Why are you doing this? I got to know. Whats your MO? What gets you out of that twin bed in the morning?"
Peter,"Because... ...because lve been me my whole life, - and lve had these powers for 6 months."
Tony,Mm-Hm.
Peter,"I read books, I build computers... And-And yeah. I would love to play football. But I couldnt then so I shouldnt now."
Tony,Sure. Cause youre different.
Peter,"Exactly. But I cant tell anybody that, so Im not. When you can do the things that I can, but you dont... and then the bad things happen, they happen because of you."
Tony,"So you wanna look out for the little guy. You wanna do your part. Make the world a better place all that, right?"
Peter,"Yeah. Yeah just looking out... for the little guy. Thats-Thats what it is. Im going to sit here, so you move the leg."
Tony,You got passport?
Peter,"Uh, no. - I dont even have a driving license."
Tony,You ever been to Germany?
Peter,No.
Tony,"Oh, youll love it."
Peter,I cant go to Germany!
Tony,Why?
Peter,I got... homework.
Tony,"Alright, I gonna pretend you didnt say that."
Peter,Im-Im being serious! I cant just drop out of school!
Tony,Might be a little dangerous. Better tell Aunt Hottie Im taking you on a field trip.
Peter,Dont tell Aunt May.
Tony,"Alright, Spider-Man. - Get me out of this."
Peter,"Im sorry, Ill get that."
Wanda,What is it?
Vision,"Stay here, please."
Clint,Guess I should have knocked.
Wanda,Oh my god. - What are you doing here?
Clint,"Disappointing my kids. Were supposed to go water skiing. Cap needs our help, come on."
Vision,Clint! You should not be here.
Clint,"Really? I retired for, what, like 5 minutes? And it all goes to shit."
Vision,Please consider the consequences of your actions.
Clint,"Okay, theyre considered. Okay, we got to go. Its this way."
Wanda,Ive caused enough problems.
Clint,"You gotta help me, Wanda. ...you can go to high school. You want to make amends. You get off your ass. Shit. I know I should have stretch."
Vision,"Clint, you cant overpower me."
Clint,"I know I cant But, she can."
Wanda,"Vision. Thats enough, let him go. - Im leaving."
Vision,I cant let you.
Wanda,Im sorry.
Vision,"If you do this, they will never stop being afraid of you."
Wanda,"I cant control their fear, only my own."
Clint,Oh... Come on. We got one more stop.
Agent,"Its just a matter of time. Our satellites are running facial, biometric and behavioral pattern scans."
Bodyguard,"Move, or you will be moved."
TChalla,As entertaining as that would be.
Natasha,You really think you can find him?
TChalla,Our resources are considerable.
Natasha,"Yeah. It took the world 70 years to find Barnes. So, you could probably do better than them by half that time."
TChalla,You know where they are?
Natasha,I know someone who does.
Sharon,Im not sure you understand the concept of a getaway car.
Steve,Its low profile.
Sharon,"Good, cause this stuff tends to draw a crowd."
Bucky,Can you move your seat up?
Sam,No. I owe you again.
Steve,Im keeping a list.
Sharon,"You know, he kind of try to kill me."
Steve,"Sorry, Ill put it on the list. Theyre going to come looking for you."
Sharon,I know.
Steve,"Thank you, Sharon. - That was..."
Sharon,Late.
Steve,Damn right.
Sharon,I should go.
Steve,Okay.
Clint,Cap.
Steve,You know I wouldnt have called If I had any other choice.
Clint,"Hey man, youre doing me a favour. Besides... Im on your team."
Steve,Thanks for having my back.
Wanda,It was time to get off my ass.
Steve,Hows our new recruit.
Clint,"Hes ready to go. I have to put a little coffee in him, but... .. he should be good."
Scott,What timezone is this?
Clint,Come on. Come on.
Scott,Captain America.
Steve,Mr. Lang.
Scott,"Its an honor. Im shaking your hand too long. Wow. This is awesome. Captain America. I know you too, youre great. Jeez. Look, I wanted to say. I know you know a lot of super people, so... Thanks for thinking of me. - Hey, man."
Sam,Whats up tic-tac.
Scott,Good to see you. Look. What happened last time was a...
Sam,"It was a great audition, but itll... itll never happen again."
Steve,Did he tell you what were up against?
Scott,Something about some... psycho assassins.
Steve,"Were outside the law on this one. So, if you come with us, youre a wanted man."
Scott,"Yeah, well, what else is new?"
Steve,We should get moving.
Clint,I got a chopper lining up.
Bucky,Theyre evacuating the airport.
Steve,Stark.
Scott,Stark?
Steve,Suit up.
Tony,"Wow, its so weird how you run into people at the airport. - Dont you just feel weird?"
Rhodes,Definitely weird.
Steve,"Hear me out, Tony. That doctor, the psychiatrist, hes behind all of this."
TChalla,Captain.
Steve,Your highness.
Tony,Anyways. Ross gave me 36 hours to bring you in. That was 24 hours ago. - Can you help a brother out?
Steve,Youre after the wrong guy.
Tony,Your judgment is askew. Your war buddy killed innocent people yesterday.
Steve,"And there are 5 more super soldiers just like him. I cant let the doctor find them first, Tony. I cant."
Natasha,"Steve. You know, whats about to happen. Do you really want to punch your way out of this one?"
Tony,"All right, Ive run out of patience. Underoos! Nice job, kid."
Peter,"Thanks. Well, I couldve stuck the landing a little better. Its... just the new suit... Well, its nothing, Mr. Stark Its-Its perfect, thank you."
Tony,"Yeah, we dont really need to start a conversation."
Peter,"Okay. Cap... Captain. Big fan, Im Spider-Man."
Tony,"Yeah, well talk about it later. Just..."
Peter,"Hey, everyone."
Tony,... good job.
Steve,Youve been busy.
Tony,And youve been a complete idiot. Dragging in Clint. Rescuing Wanda from a place she doesnt even want to leave. A safe place. Im trying to keep... Im trying to keep you from tearing the Avengers apart.
Steve,You did that when you signed.
Tony,"Alright, Im done. Youre gonna turn Barnes over and youre gonna come with us. NOW! Because its us! Were squaded JSOC, guys, with no compunction about being impolite. Come on, man."
Sam,"We found it. The quinjets in hanger five, north runway."
Steve,"Alright, Lang."
Peter,"Hey, guys. Something..."
Rhodes,Whoa. What-What the hell was that?
Scott,"I believe this is yours, Captain America."
Tony,"Oh, great. Alright, theres two on the parking deck. One of them is Maximoff, Im going to grab her. Rhodey, you want to take Cap?"
Rhodes,Got two in the terminal. Wilson and Barnes.
TChalla,Barnes is mine!
Peter,"Hey, Mr. Stark, what should I do?"
Tony,What we discussed. Keep your distance. Web em up.
Peter,"Okay, copy that!"
TChalla,"Move, Captain. I wont ask a second time."
Scot,"Look, I really dont want to hurt you."
Natasha,I wouldnt stress about it.
Bucky,What the hell is that?
Sam,Everyones got a gimmick now.
Peter,"You have a metal arm? That is awesome, dude! You have the right to remain silent!"
Rhodes,"Sorry, Cap. This wont kill you but it aint gonna tickle either."
Tony,"Wanda, I think you hurt Visions feelings."
Wanda,You locked me in my room.
Tony,"Okay. First, thats an exaggeration. Second, I did it to protect you. - Hey, Clint."
Clint,"Hey, man."
Tony,"Clearly retirement doesnt suit you, get tired of shooting golf?"
Clint,"Well, I played 18, I shot 18. Just cant seem to miss."
Tony,First time for everything.
Clint,Made you look.
FRIDAY,Multiple contusions detected.
Tony,"Yeah, I detected that too."
Peter,"Oh god. Hey buddy, I think you lost this! - Are those wings carbon fiber?"
Sam,Is this stuff coming out of you?
Peter,"That would explain the rigidity flexibility ratio which, gotta say, thats awesome man."
Sam,I dont know if youve been a fight before - but theres usually not this much talking.
Peter,"Alright, sorry, my bad. Guys, look. Id love to keep this up but Ive only got one job here today and I gotta impress Mr. Stark, so, lm really sorry. Wwahhhh!"
Bucky,You couldnt have done that earlier?
Sam,I hate you.
Scott,"Captain, heads up! Throw it at this. Now!"
Rhodes,"Oh, come on!"
Scott,"Oh, man. I thought it was a water truck. Uh... sorry."
Rhodes,"Alright. Now, Im pissed."
Natasha,"Is this, part of the plan?"
Tony,"Well, my plan was to go easy on them. You want to switch it up?"
Clint,Theres our ride.
Steve,Come on!
Vision,"Captain Rogers. I know you believe what youre doing is right. But, for the collective good, you must surrender now."
Sam,"What do we do, Cap?"
Steve,We fight.
Natasha,This isnt going to end well.
Peter,Theyre not stopping.
Tony,Neither are we.
Natasha,"Were still friends, right?"
Clint,Depends on how hard you hit me.
Wanda,Youre pulling your punches.
Bucky,I didnt kill your father.
TChalla,Then why did you run?
Bucky,No.
TChalla,Take that!
Peter,That thing does not obey the laws of physics at all.
Steve,Look kid. Theres a lot going on here that you dont understand.
Peter,Stark said youd say that. Wow. He also said to go for your legs.
Sam,"Clint, can you get him off me?"
Clint,You buckled in?
Scott,"Yeah. No, Im good. Im good, arrow-guy. Lets go. Lets go!"
Steve,Did Stark tell you anything else?
Peter,That youre wrong. You think youre right. And that makes you dangerous.
Steve,"I guess he had a point. You got heart, kid. Wherere you from?"
Peter,Queens.
Steve,Brooklyn.
Tony,Friday?
FRIDAY,We have some weapon systems offline.
Tony,They what?
Scott,"Oh, youre gonna have to take this into the shop."
Tony,Whos speaking?
Scott,Its your conscience. We dont talk a lot these days.
Tony,Friday?
FRIDAY,Deploying firing suppression system.
Scott,Oh oh. Oh boy.
Bucky,We got to go. - That guys probably in Siberia by now.
Steve,Im gonna draw all the fliers. Ill take Vision. You get to the jet.
Sam,"No, you get to the jet! Both of you! The rest of us arent getting out of here."
Clint,"As much as I hate to admit it, if were gonna win this one, some of us might have to lose it."
Sam,"This isnt the real fight, Steve."
Steve,"Alright, Sam, whats the plan?"
Sam,"We need a diversion, something big."
Scott,"I got something kind of big, but I cant hold it very long. On my signal, run like hell. And if I tear myself in half..."
Bucky,What?
Scott,Dont come back for me.
Bucky,Hes tearing himself in half?
Steve,"Youre sure about this, Scott?"
Scott,"Yeah, I do it all the time. I mean once... ...in a lab. And I passed out. Im the boss. Im the boss. Im the boss. Im the boss. Im the BEST!"
Peter,Holy shit!
Rhodes,"Okay, tiny dude is big now. Hes big now."
Steve,I guess thats the signal.
Sam,"Way to go, tic-tac!"
Tony,Give me back my Rhodey.
Peter,I got him!
Tony,"Okay. Anybody on our side hiding any shocking, and fantastic abilities theyd like to disclose, Im open to suggestion."
Scott,You want to get to them? You got to go through me.
Clint,We havent met yet. - Im Clint.
TChalla,I dont care.
Scott,Get off. Something just flew in me!
Natasha,Youre not going to stop?
Steve,You know I cant.
Natasha,Im going to regret this. Go.
Peter,Hey guys. You ever see that really old movie? - Empire Strikes Back?
Rhodes,"Jesus Tony, how old is this guy?"
Tony,"I dont know, I didnt carbon date him. Hes on the young side."
Peter,You know that part? When theyre on the snow planet? With the walking thingies?
Tony,Maybe the kids on to something.
Rhodes,"High now. Tony, go high."
Petere,YES! Ha ha! That was awesome!
Scott,Does anyone have any orange slices?
Tony,"Kid, you alright?"
Peter,Hey! - Get of me!
Tony,Guess who? - Hi.
Peter,Oh. - Hey man.
Tony,Yeah.
Peter,That was scary.
Tony,Yeah. - Youre done. Alright?
Peter,What?
Tony,You did a good job.
Peter,"No, Im good. Im fine."
Tony,Stay down.
Peter,"No, its good I gotta get him back!"
Tony,Youre going home or Ill call Aunt May! Youre done!
Peter,"Wait. Mr. Stark, wait! Im not done, Im not... Okay, Im done."
Natasha,"I said that Id help you find him, not catch him. There is a difference."
Vision,Im sorry.
Wanda,Me too.
Vision,"Its as I said, catastrophe."
Rhodey,"Vision, I got a bandit on my six. Vision, do you copy? Target his thrusters, turn him into a glider."
Tony,Rhodey?
Rhodey,"Tony, Im flying dead stick."
Tony,RHODES! Read vitals.
Friday,Heartbeat detected. Emergency medical is on its way.
Sam,Im sorry.
Front Desk Woman,"Good morning. Room service. Good morning, Mrs. Leben. -"
Zemo,This is room 201.
Room Service Lady,"Good morning, Mr. Muller. Bacon and black coffee again?"
Zemo,You know me so well.
Room Service Lady,"Hello, Your breakfast is here. May I let myself in? Mr Muller? Mr Muller? Oh God!"
Bucky,Whats gonna happen to your friends?
Steve,"Whatever it is, Ill deal with it."
Bucky,"I dont know if Im worth all this, Steve."
Steve,What you did all those years... It wasnt you. You didnt have a choice.
Bucky,I know. But I did it.
Tony,"Vision, how did this happen?"
Vision,I became distracted.
Tony,I didnt think that was possible.
Vision,Neither did I.
Tony,The doctor said he shattered L4 to S1. Extreme laceration in the spinal cord. Probably looking at some form of paralysis.
Natasha,"Steves not gonna stop. If you dont either, then Rhodeys gonna be the best case scenario."
Tony,"You let them go, Nat. -"
Natasha,We played this wrong.
Tony,"We? Boy. It must be hard to shake the whole double agent thing, huh? Sticks in the DNA."
Natasha,Are you incapable of letting go of your ego for 1 goddamn second?
Tony,"TChalla told Ross what you did, so, theyre coming for you."
Natasha,Im not the one who needs to watch their back.
Tony,"What am I looking at, Friday?"
Friday,Priority upload from Berlin police.
Tony,Fire up the chopper.
Friday,The Task Force called for a psychiatrist as soon as Barnes was captured. The UN dispatched Dr. Theo Broussard from Geneva within the hour. He was met by this man. -
Tony,Did you run a facial recognition yet? -
Friday,What do I look like?
Tony,"I dont know, but Im picturing a red head."
Friday,You must be thinking Im someone else.
Tony,I must be.
Friday,"The fake doctor is actually Colonel Helmut Zemo Sokovian intelligence. Zemo ran EKO Skorpion, a Sokovian covert kill squad."
Tony,"So, what happened to the real Broussard?"
Friday,He was found dead in a Berlin hotel room. The police also found a wig and facial prosthesis approximating the appearance of one James Buchanan Barnes.
Tony,Son of a bitch. - Get this to Ross. -
Friday,"Yes, Boss. RAFT PRISON"
Guard,"This is the Raft prison control. You are clear for landing, Mr. Stark."
Tony,"So? Did you get the files? Lets reroute the satellites, and start facial scanning for this Zemo guy."
Secretary Ross,You seriously think Im gonna listen to you even after that fiasco in Leipzig? Youre lucky youre not in one of these cells.
Clint,"The futurist, gentlemen! The futurist is here! He sees all! He knows whats best for you, whether your like it or not."
Tony,"Give me a break, Barton. I had no idea theyll put you in here, come on."
Clint,"Yeah, well, you knew theyll put us somewhere, Tony."
Tony,"Yeah. But, not some super max floating ocean pokey. You know, this place is for maniacs. This is a place for..."
Clint,"Criminals? Criminals, Tony. I think thats the word youre looking for. Right? It didnt used to mean me, or Sam, or Wanda. <nowiki> </nowiki>But, here we are. -"
Tony,Because you broke the law. -
Clint,Yeah. -
Tony,I didnt make you. -
Clint,The law. The law. The law. The law. The law.
Tony,"You read it, you broke it. Alright, youre all grown up. You got a wife and kids. I dont understand. Why didnt you think about them before you choose the wrong side?"
Clint,You better watch your back on this guy. Theres a chance hes gonna break it.
Scott,"Hank Pym always said, you never can trust a Stark."
Tony,Who are you?
Scott,"Come on, man."
Sam,Hows Rhodes?
Tony,Were flying him to Columbia Medical tomorrow. So... Fingers cross. <nowiki> </nowiki>What do you need? They feed you yet?
Sam,Youre the good cop now?
Tony,Im just a guy who needs to know where Steve went.
Sam,"Well, you better go get a bad cop, because you would have to go Mark Fuhrman on my ass to get information out of me."
Tony,"Oh, I just knocked the A out of their AV. We got about 30 seconds before they realized its not their equipment."
Secretary Ross,What did you do? Get it back up!
Tony,"Just look. Because that is the fellow who is suppose to interrogate Barnes. Clearly, I made a mistake. Sam, I was wrong."
Sam,Thats a first.
Tony,Cap is definitely off the reservation and hes about to need all the help he can get. We dont know each other very well. You dont have to...
Sam,"Hey. Its alright. Look, I will tell you. But you have to go alone and as a friend."
Tony,Easy.
Secretary Ross,"Stark, did he give you anything on Rogers?"
Tony,"No, he told me to go to hell. Im going back to the compound instead. But, you can call me anytime. Ill put you on hold, I like to watch the line blink."
Steve,You remember that time we had to ride back from Rockaway Beach in the back of that freezer truck?
Bucky,Was that the time we used our train money to buy hot dogs?
Steve,You blew 3 bucks trying to win that stuffed bear for a redhead. -
Bucky,What was her name again? -
Steve,Dolores. You called her Dot.
Bucky,Shes got to be a hundred years old by now.
Steve,"So are we, pal. He cant have been here more than a few hours."
Bucky,Long enough to wake them up.
Steve,You ready?
Bucky,Yeah.
Tony,You seem a little defensive.
Steve,Its been a long day.
Tony,"At ease, soldier. Im not currently after you."
Steve,Then why are you here?
Tony,Could be your storys not so crazy.
Steve,Maybe.
Tony,"Ross has no idea Im here, Id like to keep it that way. Otherwise, I gotta arrest myself."
Steve,"Well, that sounds like a lot of paper work. - Its good to see you, Tony. -"
Tony,"Me too, Cap. Hey, Manchurian candidate, youre killing me. Theres a truce here, you can drop  -"
Tony,I got heat signatures. -
Steve,How many?
Tony,"Uh, one."
Zemo,"If its any comfort, they died in their sleep. Did you really think I wanted more of you?"
Bucky,What the hell?
Zemo,"Im grateful to them though, they brought you here. Please, Captain. The Soviets built this chamber to withstand the launch blast of a few a 100 rockets."
Tony,Im betting I can beat that.
Zemo,"Oh, Im sure you could, Mr. Stark. Given time. But then youll never know why you came."
Steve,You killed innocent people in Vienna just to bring us here?
Zemo,"I thought about nothing else for over a year. I studied you, I followed you. But now that you are standing here, I just realized... Theres a bit of green in the blue of your eyes. How nice to find a flaw."
Steve,Youre Sokovian. Is that what this is about?
Zemo,Sokovia was a failed state long before you blew it to hell. No. Im here because I made a promise.
Steve,You lost someone.
Zemo,I lost everyone. And so will you. <nowiki> </nowiki>An empire topple by its enemies can rise again. But one which crumples from within... thats dead ...forever.
Tony,I know that road. What is this?
Howard,Help my wife. Please. Help her. Sergeant Barnes?
Maria,Howard. Howard! Help.
Steve,Tony. Tony.
Tony,Did you know?
Steve,I didnt know it was him.
Tony,"Dont bullshit me, Rogers! Did you know?"
Steve,"Yes. Get out of here! It wasnt him, Tony. Hydra had controlled of his mind!"
Tony,Move!
Steve,It wasnt him!
Friday,Left boot-jet failing. Flight systems compromised.
Tony,Ah crap.
Steve,Hes not going to stop. Go. -
Bucky,Come on. Come on.
Friday,"Targeting systems inaccurate, Boss."
Tony,Im eye balling it. Do you even remember them?
Bucky,I remember all of them.
Steve,This isnt gonna change what happened.
Tony,I dont care. He killed my mom.
Zemos Wife,"You shouldve seen his little face. Just try, okay? Im going to bed. I love you."
TChalla,I almost kill the wrong man.
Zemo,Hardly an innocent one.
TChalla,Is this what you wanted? To see them ripped each other apart.
Zemo,"My father lived outside the city. I thought we would be safe there. My son was excited. He could see the Iron Man from the car window. And I told my wife, ""Dont worry. "" ""They are fighting in the city. We are miles from harm. "" When the dust cleared, and the screaming stopped. It took me two days until I found their bodies. My father... still holding my wife and son in his arms. And the Avengers... they went home. I knew I couldnt kill them. More powerful men than me have tried. But, if I could get them to kill each other? Im sorry about your father. He seemed a good man. With a dutiful son."
