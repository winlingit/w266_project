narrator,movie opens with a 4 year-old Peter Parker playing hide and seek and looking for his father
Peter Parker - age 4,"Five, four, three, two, one. Ready or not, here I come. [Peter goes into his fathers study and sees that it has been tossed and gets scared] Dad! Dad! [Peters father enters looking concerned, he pulls out a drawer from his desk and removes a false bottom hiding a file, he takes the file, wipes off the equations on his blackboard, Peters mothers carries Peter out of the office and as they leave we see a spider encased in glass on the desk] [after taking Peter to his uncle Ben and Aunt Mays house]"
Richard Parker,Youre gonna stay with your Aunt May and and Uncle Ben for a little while.
Peter Parker - age 4,"I wanna go with you. [Richard kisses Peter, then Peters mother tenderly strokes Peters face as she cries and gives instructions to May]"
Mary Parker,He doesnt like crust on his sandwiches and he likes to sleep with a little light on at night.
Richard Parker,Come on.
Peter Parker - age 4,Dad?
Richard Parker,"Be good. Richard turns and walks out of the house with Peters mother] [we see Peter, now a teenager, putting up his photo of the debate team and as hes doing this he gets hit in the head with a basketball thrown by the school bully, Flash Thompson, who laughs at Peter and tries to scare Peter before walking off, as Peter walks down the school hallway he gets approached by a student]"
Hot Girl,"Hey, its uh...Peter, right?"
Peter Parker,Mmhmm.
Hot Girl,I really like your photos.
Peter Parker,"Oh, thanks."
Hot Girl,"Uh..listen, are you busy Friday night?"
Peter Parker,Uh... [Peter looks speechless then shakes his head]
Hot Girl,"Cool! Uh...can you take pictures of my boyfriends car. I just, you know, I really wanna frame a good one for his Birthday."
Peter Parker,"Thats really nice of you. Wow, thats such a nice thought. Um...yeah, Ill have a look at the old uh...the old schedule."
Hot Girl,"Okay. [at lunch in the school yard, Peter sees Flash bullying another kid, shoving his face in his food, and all the other kids around him chanting along for the kid to eat the food]"
Flash Thompson,"Hey, Parker, come on! Get a picture of this, come on."
Peter Parker,"Im not gonna take a picture of this. Put him down, man. Put his down, man. [to the kid] Dont eat it. Dont eat it."
Flash Thompson,"Take the picture, Parker!"
Peter Parker,"Put him down, Flash."
Flash Thompson,Take a picture.
Peter Parker,"Put him down! Eugene! [the other students laugh, Flash drops the kid and suddenly punches Peter] Get up! Come on! Come on! [Flash kicks Peter in the stomach and Peter doubles up in pain]"
Peter Parker,Im still not taking the picture.
Flash Thompson,"Stay down, Parker! [Flash turns to the crowd of students and starts shouting] Who wants one more! Huh? Huh? [Gwen who was sitting on her own in the year, walks over and calmly intervenes] Who wants one more! Huh? Huh? [Gwen who was sitting on her own in the year, walks over and calmly intervenes]"
Gwen Stacy,"Flash! Flash, are we still on for after school today? My house, three thirty? I hope youve been doing your homework. Last time I was very disappointed in you."
Flash Thompson,"Okay, listen..."
Gwen Stacy,"No, Flash, how about we go to class, hmm? How about it?"
Flash Thompson,"Whatever. [the school bell rings, Flash turns and walks off, Gwen gives Peter a look before walking off, Peter then finds his camera which is broken] ]later in class, after the Flash bullying incident]"
Gwen Stacy,"I thought that was great, what you did back there. It was stupid, but it was great. You should probably go to the nurse, you might have a concussion. Whats your name?"
Peter Parker,You dont know my name?
Gwen Stacy,"No, I know your name. I just wanna know if you know your name."
Peter Parker,Peter...Parker. Peter Parker.
Gwen Stacy,"Okay, good. [she smiles and turns her face from Peter, Peter gives a longing look] Id still go to the nurse though."
Peter Parker,"Youre Gwen, right?"
Gwen Stacy,"Gwen Stacy. [later at home with his aunt, referring to his beat up looking face]"
Aunt May,"Oh, my God! What happened to your face?"
Peter Parker,"Oh, Im alright. I just...I fell, skating. Its alright. [Peters uncle walks into the kitchen carrying an looking box]"
Uncle Ben,[to Peter] What happened to you?
Uncle Ben,What happened to you?
Aunt May,"He fell. Why you kids ride those things, Ill never know."
Uncle Ben,Cause its stupid and dangerous. Remember when we were stupid and dangerous?
Aunt May,No.
Uncle Ben,"Trust me, we were."
Peter Parker,"Good to know. [referring to his uncles rolled up trousers and bare feet] Hey, wheres the flood?"
Uncle Ben,"Follow me, Ill show you."
Peter Parker,You serious?
Uncle Ben,"Yes! [Peter follows his uncle to the basement] [in the basement, showing Peter the flood] I think its a condenser tray."
Peter Parker,"No, too much water for the condenser tray or the heat exchange tubing. This has gotta be the filling."
Uncle Ben,Thats the only thing that makes sense then. Can you fix it?
Peter Parker,"No, not tonight. Ill go by the hardware store tomorrow."
Uncle Ben,"Good deal. Meanwhile, put this on your face. [he give Peter an ice pack] How does the other guy look? [Peter doesnt reply]"
Peter Parker,"No, no."
Uncle Ben,"I wouldnt tell your Aunt May. Id pity the poor kid whod have to suffer her wrath. [Peters uncle starts going back upstairs] Hey, before you come up, see if theres anything else worth saving."
Peter Parker,"Yeah. [as Peter looks around the basement he notices a leather briefcase that belonged to his father and takes it] [after finding his fathers briefcase, he takes it to his room, he examines the briefcase further and finds a secret pocket that contains a folder of his fatherâ€™s equations, the main equation is marked with the symbol of two zeros crossed with diagonal lines] What is this? [reading from the notes in the file] Zero, zero, Decay Rate Algorithm. [theres a knock on his bedroom door] Yeah, one sec! One sec! [Peter quickly hides the briefcase and unlocks his door] Come in."
Uncle Ben,You okay?
Peter Parker,"Yeah, whats up? [referring to Peters father] Oh, my God! You look just like him. [Peter takes off his glasses]"
Uncle Ben,May I come in?
Peter Parker,Yeah.
Uncle Ben,"Listen, um...I dont have much education, you know, Peter. Hell, I stopped being able to help with your homework when you were ten. What Im trying to say is, I know its been rough for you without your dad. And I know we dont talk much about them."
Peter Parker,"Yeah, its fine."
Uncle Ben,"No, it is not alright. I wish I could change it, but I cant. [referring to photo of Gwen that Peter has on his computer screen] Shes pretty. [as Peters uncle is about to leave Peters room]"
Peter Parker,Uncle Ben?
Uncle Ben,Yeah?
Peter Parker,"Youre a pretty great dad, alright? [Peters uncle smiles] [after Peter researches Connors online, he finds that he is working on cross-species genetics at OsCorp and Peter goes to OsCorp Tower]"
Receptionist,Excuse me?
Peter Parker,What?
Receptionist,Can I help you?
Peter Parker,"Oh, uh...I dont know. Im here...Im here to see Dr. Connors."
Receptionist,Right. Youll find yourself to the left. [Peter looks at her blankly] You are here for the internship?
Peter Parker,Yeah. Yeah.
Receptionist,Okay. Youll find your badge to the left. [Peter looks to the left and sees the name badges]
Peter Parker,Oh!
Receptionist,Are you having trouble finding yourself?
Peter Parker,No. I got it. [he quickly picks up a badge for Rodrigo Guevara]
Receptionist,"Okay, Mr. Guevara."
Peter Parker,Gracias. [as Peter heads upstairs in OsCorp Tower he finds the group of interns gather and Gwen introducing herself to them]
Gwen Stacy,"Welcome to OsCorp. My name is Gwen Stacy, Im a senior at Midtown Science and Im also head intern to Dr. Connors, so Ill be with you for the duration of your visit. Where I go, you go. Thats the basic rule. If you remember that, all will be fine. If you forget that, then... [at that moment we hear the real Rodrigo Guevara shouting his name as hes being dragged away by security] Well, I guess I dont need to tell you what happens if you forget that. Shall we. [Peter tries to hide his face and stay in the back as Gwen gives the interns a tour of OsCorp] [as Gwen takes the interns to a lab in OsCorp, with Peter hiding in the back of the group, Connors appears and addresses the interns]"
Dr. Curt Connors,"Welcome, my name is Dr. Curtis Connors. And yes, in case youre wondering, Im a southpaw. [the interns laugh] Im not a cripple, Im a former scientist and Im the worlds foremost authority on herpetology. Thats reptiles, for those of you who dont know. But like the Parkinsons patient who watches on in horror as her body slowly betrays her, or the man with macular degeneration whos eyes grow dimer each day, I long to fix myself. I want to create a world without weakness. Anyone care to venture a guess just how? [one of the interns puts up their hand] Yes?"
OsCorp Intern,Stem cells?
Dr. Curt Connors,"Promising, but the solution Im thinking of is more radical. [the interns all look at each other] No one?"
Peter Parker,"Cross-species genetics. [everyone turns and looks at Peter at the back of the group, Gwen looks at her list of intern names] A person gets Parkinsons when the brain cells that produce dopamine start to disappear. But the zebrafish has the ability to regenerate cells on command. If you can somehow give this ability to the woman youre talking about, thats that. Shes...shes curing herself."
OsCorp Intern,"Yeah, you just have to look past the gills on her neck. [the other interns laugh]"
Dr. Curt Connors,And you are?
Gwen Stacy,Hes one of Midtown Sciences best and brightest.
Dr. Curt Connors,Really?
Gwen Stacy,Hmm. Hes second in his class.
Dr. Curt Connors,Oh.
Peter Parker,Second?
Gwen Stacy,Yeah.
Peter Parker,You sure about that?
Gwen Stacy,"Im pretty sure. [at that moment Connors phone rings and he excuses himself and leaves the interns with Gwen] [after Connors leaves, Peter tries to sneak away but Gwen stops him] Hi. How you doin, Rodrigo? [Peter looks at his badge and realizes that shes referring to the name on his badge]"
Peter Parker,"Oh, yeah."
Gwen Stacy,What are you doing here?
Peter Parker,"I work here. I dont work here. I was gonna say...I was gonna say I work here, but I seems like in fact you work here. So you know that I dont in fact work here."
Gwen Stacy,Are you following me?
Peter Parker,"No, Im not following...Im not following you. No, Im not. I had no idea worked here."
Gwen Stacy,Then why would you be here?
Peter Parker,"I just snuck in because, I love science."
Gwen Stacy,You love science?
Peter Parker,I am passionate about it.
Gwen Stacy,So you snuck in. I have to lead this tour group.
Peter Parker,I know.
Gwen Stacy,So Im gonna ask you more about this later. Do not get me in trouble.
Peter Parker,"I promise you, I wont."
Gwen Stacy,"Stay with the group. [as Gwen heads back to take the interns round the building, Peter tries to sneak off but bumps into Rajit Ratha, who drops a file that has the same double zero symbol that Peter saw in his fathers file]"
Dr. Curt Connors,"We received the results from the MRNA sequences, they were disappointing."
Rajit Ratha,So define disappointing.
Dr. Curt Connors,Im at a dead end. Its the Decay Rate Algorithm. But this is to be expected.
Rajit Ratha,Expected? You said you were close.
Dr. Curt Connors,"We are close, but its gonna take time."
Rajit Ratha,"He doesnt have time. Norman Osborn is dying, Dr. Connors. Save him, or well both lose our heads. [as Peter goes back to rejoin the intern group, Gwen notices that hed snuck off again]"
Peter Parker,I...
Gwen Stacy,"Give me the badge. Give it to me. [Peter reluctantly takes the badge off, as he does this we one of the spider from the lab crawling on the back of Peters coat collar, Peter gives the badge back to Gwen]"
Peter Parker,"Sorry. [as Gwen turns to leave, suddenly Peter is bit on the back of his neck by the spider] [after getting bit by the spider, Peters leaves OsCorp and takes a ride on the subway and falls asleep, a thug seeing Peter asleep decides to balance a beer bottle on Peters forehead, when a drop of condensation touches Peters skin, he suddenly springs awake and lands on the subway car ceiling, hanging upside down and then falls down, then as the beer had spilled on the thugs girlfriend she starts complaining]"
Girl on Subway,Disgusting! Now I smell like beer!
Peter Parker,Im sorry. I didnt mean to do that. I...I uh...I [as Peter tries to apologize to her his hand sticks to her shirt]
Subway Guy,Get your hand off her!
Peter Parker,Im trying...to get my hand... [the thug gets angry and pushes Peter which tears his girlfriends shirt right off]
Subway Guy,Are you kidding?
Peter Parker,Im sorry.
Subway Guy,"Are you freaking kidding me? [the thug gets angry and tries to attack Peter, but suddenly Peter is fast with incredible reflexes and moves so fast that the thug falls and hurts himself]"
Peter Parker,"Im sorry! Oh, man, are you alright? [Peter senses the other thugs moving to attack him and he quickly lifts his legs and knocks them out] [after the subway incident, Peter runs home and sees his aunt and uncle waiting up for him]"
Peter Parker,"Hey, sorry, Im late. I uh..."
Aunt May,We were so worried!
Peter Parker,"I know, Im sorry. Watch...! [suddenly Peter sees a fly and quickly captures it with his hand]"
Aunt May,"Thats a fly, Peter. [Peter looks at the fly and then lets it go]"
Peter Parker,"Yeah. Im so sorry I kept you guys up. Im insensitive, Im irresponsible. And Im hungry! [Peter goes into the kitchen and takes out a plate of food from the fridge and starts eating]"
Aunt May,Is he okay?
Uncle Ben,I dont think so.
Peter Parker,[as hes chomping down the food] This is...this is your meatloaf. This beats all other meatloafs!
Aunt May,[to Ben] Something is very wrong.
Uncle Ben,"Yeah. Nobody likes your meatloaf. [Peters aunt and uncle stare in shock as Peter empties the fridge and heads to his room, May catches one of the items as falls from his arm]"
Aunt May,[to Ben as they watch Peter go upstairs] He took the frozen macaroni and cheese!
Uncle Ben,I noticed that.
Aunt May,Why didnt you tell me you didnt like my meatloaf?
Uncle Ben,Um...
Aunt May,"You could have said that to me thirty seven years ago! How many meatloafs have I made for you?! [in his room, Peter is sweating and touches the spider bite at the back of his neck, he pulls away a thread of silk from which the spider is still clinging onto, the next morning Peter wakes up and not realizing his own strength breaks his alarm clock and his bathroom sink as he tries to brush his teeth, as he heads back to his room he starts hearing the spider thats crawling on his window, scared as whats happening to him he starts to look up spider bites online, after which the keypads on his computer stick to his fingers] [Peter goes to visit Connors at his home]"
Peter Parker,"Dr. Connors, uh...you dont remember me. I uh..."
Dr. Curt Connors,Youre the intern from the other day.
Peter Parker,"Yeah, thats right."
Dr. Curt Connors,"Im sure youre a very nice young man, but this is a home. Id ask you to make an appointment in my office. [as Connors is about the shut the door]"
Dr. Curt Connors,"Peter? [as Connors pours coffee for them] Im afraid I cant help you much, Peter. I dont know why they left or where they were going. [Connors accidently knocks down one of the coffee cups which Peter quickly catches] Good reflexes."
Peter Parker,Thank you. [Peter passes Connors coffee up to him]
Dr. Curt Connors,Thank you.
Peter Parker,I read your book.
Dr. Curt Connors,Oh?
Peter Parker,"Yeah. Its something. So you really think its possible, cross-species genetics?"
Dr. Curt Connors,"Yes, of course. But for years your father and I were mocked for our theories, not just in the community at large, but at OsCorp as well. They called us mad scientists. And then your father bred the spider and everything changed. The results were beyond encouraging, they were spectacular. We were gonna change the live of millions, including my own. Then it was over. He...he was gone, took his research with him. And then I knew without him I...I...I was angry, so I stayed away from you and your family. And for that Im truly sorry."
Peter Parker,Say...say it worked. Say you got it to work. Like how much would the foreign species take over? What...what could the side effects be?
Dr. Curt Connors,"Its hard to say, considering no subjects survived. The problem was always..."
Peter Parker,Decay Rate Algorithm?
Dr. Curt Connors,Right.
Peter Parker,[Peter points to a pencil paper] Right. Can I uh...
Dr. Curt Connors,"Of course. [Peter sits and writes out the algorithm from his fathers notes and passes it to Connors] Extraordinary. How did you come up with this? [Peter points to his head and smiles] Peter, how would you feel about coming to see me at the Tower one day after school?"
Peter Parker,Yeah.
Dr. Curt Connors,Thank you. [after Peter is pulled into the principals office for humiliating Flash whilst playing basketball and shattering the backboard as he dunks the ball over Flashs head]
Peter Parker,I hope theyre not gonna make us pay for the backboard.
Uncle Ben,I dont care about the backboard. Was that true?
Peter Parker,What?
Uncle Ben,"What I heard in there, just now? Did you humiliate that boy?"
Peter Parker,"Yeah, I did. But..."
Uncle Ben,But what?
Peter Parker,This guy...this guy deserved it.
Uncle Ben,Did he?
Peter Parker,Yeah.
Uncle Ben,Is he the kid that hit you? [Peter looks away] Is he?
Peter Parker,"Yeah. Yeah, but..."
Uncle Ben,"So all this is about getting even? If so, I guess you must feel pretty good about yourself now, right? Am I right or wrong? [Peter doesnt reply and looks down] Yeah, I thought so. Well, thanks to this little escapade of yours, I had to change shifts at work. So you have to pick Aunt May tonight at nine oclock, understood? Is that understood?"
Peter Parker,Yeah.
Uncle Ben,"Okay. Good. [as they stand in the school hallway, Ben notices Gwen standing behind them] She looks familiar. [Peter looks back and sees its Gwen] Shes the girl on your computer. Yeah. [to Gwen] Hes got you on his computer. Im his probation officer. [to Peter] Dont forget Aunt May."
Peter Parker,Okay. [Ben walks off and Peter laughs nervously as he turns to Gwen] Hes a character. Hes my uncle. He um...hes a pathological lier and thought you were someone else.
Gwen Stacy,"[jokingly] Oh, man. You dont have me on your computer?"
Peter Parker,"Yeah. Well, I mean like, I had a...I took a photo of the debate team and youre in the debate team, so."
Gwen Stacy,Right.
Peter Parker,"So, he must have seen...um...cause I was touching up stuff."
Gwen Stacy,You were touching up stuff? [they both laugh]
Peter Parker,I was...I was...Im not gonna answer that.
Gwen Stacy,Did you get expelled?
Peter Parker,No. No. I didnt get expelled. I got community service. Um...so uh...you wanna uh...I dont know. Um...
Gwen Stacy,Wanna what?
Peter Parker,"I dont know. Just uh....I dont know. I dont know. We could uh...or we could do something else. Or we could, if you dont like...we could..."
Gwen Stacy,What? Yeah.
Peter Parker,Yeah?
Gwen Stacy,"Yeah, either one."
Peter Parker,Really?
Gwen Stacy,Sure.
Peter Parker,Okay. Good. Sounds good.
Gwen Stacy,Cool.
Peter Parker,"Okay. You know, I cant right now. I cant right now."
Gwen Stacy,"Yeah, I know."
Peter Parker,Im so busy right now.
Gwen Stacy,Me too.
Peter Parker,But uh...maybe uh...
Gwen Stacy,"Yeah, just, you know?"
Peter Parker,Some other...
Gwen Stacy,Time.
Peter Parker,Okay. Alright. [Gwen turns]
Gwen Stacy,"Bye. [Peter watches Gwen as she walks down the hallway and she turns and smiles at him] [after visiting Connors at OsCorp Tower, Peter notices an old piece of equipment in the lab]"
Peter Parker,"I remember that, Ive seen that before."
Dr. Curt Connors,The Ganali Device.
Peter Parker,"Yeah, I remember a picture of that in my dads office."
Dr. Curt Connors,"The idea was so simple, you load it with an antigen, it creates a cloud which can be dispersed over a neighborhood, even an entire city. Theoretically you could cure Polio in an afternoon."
Peter Parker,Its incredible.
Dr. Curt Connors,"Well, others disagreed. You know, what if the device were loaded with a toxin? What if you wanted to opt out? You cant run away from a cloud after all, so here it lies, gathering dust. What you see here is a computer model of lizard. Many of these wonderful creatures are so brilliantly adaptive that they can regenerate entire limbs at will. You can imagine my envy. Were trying to harness this capability in transferring into our host subject, Freddie, the three legged mouse. [to Peter] Enter the algorithm now. [just as Peter is about the enter his fathers algorithm into the computer, he gets a call from his uncle] Do you need to take that? [Peter shakes his head and rejects the call]"
Peter Parker,Okay. Check. See what Im trying to do?
Dr. Curt Connors,Preempt the protein.
Peter Parker,"Preempt the immune response. [after several failed attempts for the mouse to regrow a limb, the computer finally declares the regeneration has been successful and the mouse has regrown a limb]"
Dr. Curt Connors,"Extraordinary. [to Peter] And thank you. [then Connor shows Peter their live mouse test subjects] Meet Fred and Wilma, our three legged mice. [Connor gives one of the mice to Peter]"
Peter Parker,"Hey, buddy. I got you."
Dr. Curt Connors,"Okay. Careful, wouldnt want to inject you by mistake. Human trials arent until next week. [he smiles at Peter and injects the mouse] There. [after his visit at OsCorp, Peter returns home late at night]"
Uncle Ben,"You owe your aunt an apology. Big time! Be a man, get in there an apologize. [they enter the house]"
Peter Parker,"Im sorry, Aunt May. I..."
Aunt May,"Honestly, you dont have to apologize to me."
Uncle Ben,The hell he doesnt!
Aunt May,Ben.
Peter Parker,"Look, Im sorry, Uncle Ben. I uh...I got distracted, I was OsCorp..."
Uncle Ben,"Oh, you got distracted."
Peter Parker,Yeah.
Uncle Ben,"Youre Aunt, my wife, had to walk twelve blocks, alone in the middle of night and then wait in a deserted subway station, because you got distracted."
Aunt May,"Ben, sweetheart, honestly, I am completely capable of walking home by myself..."
Uncle Ben,You will not defend this boy!
Aunt May,Im not defending him!
Uncle Ben,"You are defending him! Listen to me, son."
Peter Parker,"Yeah, go ahead."
Uncle Ben,"Youre a lot like your father. You really are, Peter, and thats a good thing. But your father lived by a philosophy, a principle really. He believed that...that if you could do good things for other people, you had a moral obligation to do those things. Thats what at stake here. Not a choice, responsibility."
Peter Parker,"That is nice. Thats really...thats great. Thats all well and good, so where is he?"
Uncle Ben,What?
Peter Parker,Where is he? Wheres my dad? He didnt think it was his responsibility to be here and tell me this himself?
Uncle Ben,"Oh, come on! How dare you?"
Peter Parker,How dare I? How dare you? [Peter turns and walks out of the house in anger]
Uncle Ben,"Where are you going? Peter, come back here! Please! [as Peter closes the front door, not realizing his own strength, the glass completely shatters, Peter runs off]"
Aunt May,"Ben, leave him alone for a little while. Hell be alright. [Ben goes after Peter, calling out his name, we Peter hiding up a subway pole] [after his angry encounter with his uncle, Peter goes to the grocery store to buy chocolate milk]"
Store Clerk,Thats two-o-seven. [Peters puts his money on the counter but its not enough] Uh...its two-o-seven.
Peter Parker,"Yeah. No, I know."
Store Clerk,"Here, youre holding up the line. [Peter takes pennies from the ""leave a penny, take a penny"" tray to make up the difference] No, you can leave a penny. You cant take a penny."
Peter Parker,What?
Store Clerk,"You cant leave a penny anytime, you have to spend ten dollars to take a penny. Store policy. You gonna pay? Youre holding up my line!"
Peter Parker,I dont have two cents.
Store Clerk,"You cant afford your milk, just step aside. What, daddy didnt give you enough milk money today?"
Peter Parker,"Its two cents, were talking about two cents."
Store Clerk,"Just step aside, kid. [Peter is about to leave when he notices that the next customer deliberately knocks a bunch of stuff off the counter] Really? [as the store clerk bends to collect the stuff off the floor, the customer grabs the cash from the till and tosses the chocolate milk that Peter couldnt buy to Peter before taking off, the store clerk goes after the thief and Peter watches him] Hey, stop! Somebody stop that guy! [to Peter] Hey, kid, a little help?"
Peter Parker,"Not my policy. [Peter turns and walks off, on the other side of the street, Ben hears the store clerk yelling for help, he sees the thief trip and fall, dropping a gun out of his coat, Ben tries to grab the gun but gets shot in the chest, Peter runs to help, but by the time he gets there Ben is dead] [Peter feeling guilty and miserable after his uncles death, listens to the last voice message his uncle had left him]"
Uncle Ben,"Peter, I know things have been difficult lately, and Im sorry about that. I think I know what youre feeling. [after his uncles death, at school, Peter tries to keep his head down]"
Flash Thompson,"Hey, Parker?"
Peter Parker,"Not today, Flash."
Flash Thompson,"Hey, come on, man. I just wanna talk... [as Flash gives Peter a friendly pat on the back, suddenly Peter grabs Flash by the neck and and holds him against the lockers] It feels better, right? Look, your uncle died. Im sorry. I get it. Im sorry. [Peter lets Flash go and begins crying] Okay? [Peter nods his head, walks off and runs into Gwen, who was watching all this]"
Gwen Stacy,"Peter. [she hugs Peter, but he just walks away] [after Peter goes looking for thief that killed his uncle, Peter encounters a thug resembles the thief but after getting into a fight with him and saving him from falling off a building Peter sees that he doesnt have the star tattoo on his wrist and lets him go, as he walks away Peter falls through the roof and lands in a Mexican wresting wring]"
Thug,"I know what you look like! You hear me! Ive seen your face! [Peter looks around him and sees an old Mexican wrestling poster and decides to make himself a mask based on this and as he hones his crime-fighting skills and designs mechanical web-shooters using the industrial spider silk packets from Oscorp] [referring to Peter, whos been intercepting criminals that look like the man that killed his uncle]"
Captain Stacy,You got a description?
Police Officer,"Well, no. He wears a mask."
Captain Stacy,A mask?
Police Officer,"Yeah, and most of his victims are suspects, some of them with serious rap sheets. Theyre calling him a vigilante."
Captain Stacy,"Okay, hes not a vigilante. Hes an anarchist. [just then Peter drops one the criminals he captured in his spider web in front of the police headquarters after this Peter then customizes a spandex suit] [in a parking lot, a car thief brakes into a car, as hes about to start the car, Peter, dressed in his Spider-Man costume interrupts him]"
Spider-Man,"Ahem, you know, in the future, if youre gonna steal cars, dont dress like a car thief, man."
Car Thief,"What, are you a cop?"
Spider-Man,"Really? You seriously think Im a cop? Cop in a skintight red and blue suit? You know, youre...youre...you got a mind of true scholar, sir. [Peter hits him in the face with his web-shooter] [as the car thief pulls a knife on Peter]"
Car Thief,Just let me go.
Spider-Man,"Is that a knife? Is that a real knife? [Spider-Man falls on his knees, pretending to be afraid]"
Car Thief,"Yes, its a real knife."
Spider-Man,"My weakness, its small knives."
Car Thief,Just let me go.
Spider-Man,"Anything, but knives! [suddenly Peter shoots his web-shooter capturing the hand of the thief holding the knife] Oh, its so simple. That was cool, man."
Car Thief,What the hell is this?
Spider-Man,Webbing that I developed myself. I dont think you really wanna know anymore right now.
Car Thief,Come on! Let me go! [Spider-Man shoots his web-shooter again capturing the thiefs other hand in a web]
Spider-Man,"Okay, one second! One second! [Spider-Man pretends to sneeze and shoot another web which lands in the middle of the thiefs crotch]"
Car Thief,"Come on, let me go! [Spider-Man keeps shooting web at the thief] Stop it! [Peter laughs]"
Car Thief,That isnt funny!
Spider-Man,It is kind of funny.
Car Thief,Come on! Help! Help!
Spider-Man,"Ssh! [Spider-Man shoots another web which lands on the thiefs mouth, shutting him up] [as Spider-Man has the thief wrapped up in his web against the wall, he checks the thiefs wrist for the star tattoo, but sees that hasnt got one] This could have gotten a lot worse. Now, hold still. [Spider-Man cuts a hole in the web across the thiefs mouth so that he can breath, at that moment a cop arrives on his bike] Oh, the boys in blue are here! I got him!"
Car Thief Cop,"[as the cop arrives, he points his gun at Spider-Man] Freeze! You in the tights, dont move!"
Spider-Man,You serious?
Car Thief Cop,Who are you?
Spider-Man,No one seems to grasp the concept of the mask. [Spider-Man moves towards the cop]
Car Thief Cop,"Freeze! [the cop starts shooting at Spider-Man, which Spider-Man easily dodges and then grabs his gun]"
Spider-Man,"I just did eighty percent of your job! Huh? Thats how you repay me? [when the rest of the police arrive, Spider-Man makes a run for it]"
Captain Stacy,"[to the police officers who have failed to capture Peter] Thirty-eight of New Yorks finest, versus one guy in a unitard. Am I correct? [Peter turns up late at home and find his aunt waiting up for him]"
Aunt May,Where were you?
Peter Parker,I was out.
Aunt May,Did you get the eggs?
Peter Parker,Nope. Forgot the eggs! Im gonna get it now.
Aunt May,"No, you most certainly will not! Not at this hour! [Peter turns away from his aunt] Look at me, Peter? Take off the damn hood and look at me. [Peter takes off his hood and turns to face his aunt, his face looking beat up] Where do you go? Who does this to you?"
Peter Parker,"Please go to sleep, Aunt May."
Aunt May,Please tell me.
Peter Parker,"Aunt May, please, please please go to sleep!"
Aunt May,"I cant sleep! Dont you understand? I cant sleep! [theres a moment of silence] Peter, listen to me. Secrets have a cost, theyre not for free. Not now, not ever."
Dr. Curt Connors,Cross-species genetics is finally working. Ive used lizard DNA to help Freddie regrow that limb.
Rajit Ratha,Its a miracle.
Dr. Curt Connors,"No, its hard work and a promise, and its a step closer to the primate lab."
Rajit Ratha,"Ah, but he doesnt have time for every little step."
Dr. Curt Connors,Little?
Rajit Ratha,I just mean he cant wait.
Dr. Curt Connors,"Well, hell have to. Unless he wants to be a lab rat."
Rajit Ratha,Thats not what Im saying.
Dr. Curt Connors,So what are you saying?
Rajit Ratha,"You have to start human trials, now."
Dr. Curt Connors,"No, I dont. And no, I wont."
Rajit Ratha,"Well, then hes going to die."
Dr. Curt Connors,"People die, even Norman Osborn."
Rajit Ratha,We are not finished.
Dr. Curt Connors,Human trials? Where on earth are you gonna find the people to volunteer?
Rajit Ratha,"The wards, as far as anyones concerned, its for a winter flu shot. I might think that veterans hospitals a place to start."
Dr. Curt Connors,You gotta be kidding me?
Rajit Ratha,"I dont think I am. [Connors turns to leave, but Ratha stops him by holding his amputated arm] Its a little late for shock and indignation, Curt. About fifteen years late."
Dr. Curt Connors,Ive no idea what youre talking about?
Rajit Ratha,"Richard Parker wore it well. On you, its a cheap suit, as it was then."
Dr. Curt Connors,I have nothing to do with that.
Rajit Ratha,"Is that what you told his son, Peter?"
Dr. Curt Connors,I dont know what youre saying.
Rajit Ratha,"You dont know, or you dont wanna know? [after Connors has refused to do human trials on the new cross-species genetics formula] [turning to the mouse] Right, Freddie? [Ratha walks out of the Connors office] [Gwen catches Peter in the school hallway]"
Peter Parker,Hows it going?
Gwen Stacy,Where are you headed?
Peter Parker,"Uh...Monday, B-track."
Gwen Stacy,Its Thursday.
Peter Parker,Its Thursday?
Gwen Stacy,What happened to your eye?
Peter Parker,Where?
Gwen Stacy,"Youre eye, it looks bruised."
Peter Parker,"Oh! Yeah, yeah! I dont know. Maybe I got a rash."
Gwen Stacy,Its pretty bad. Have you gone to the nurse?
Peter Parker,Mmhmm.
Gwen Stacy,Do you like branzino? [Peter looks at her blankly] Like the fish?
Peter Parker,"Mmhmm. No, I know. I know. I know."
Gwen Stacy,"Well, if you want, you can come to this address at uh...at eight oclock tonight. [she writes the address on a piece of paper and gives it to Peter] My moms making Branzino, so. [Peter looks at the address] Oh, its apartment twenty sixteen. I didnt...I didnt write that part down. I dont why I didnt. [she turns and laughs]"
Peter Parker,Ill remember it.
Gwen Stacy,"Twenty sixteen. [Gwen walks off to her class] [that evening, Peter shows up outside Gwens bedroom window and knocks on the window] Hi! How did you get out there?"
Peter Parker,The fire escape. Your doormans intimidating.
Gwen Stacy,Thats twenty stories!
Peter Parker,"Yeah, its alright. [Peter enters Gwens room] This is your room?"
Gwen Stacy,"Yes, this is my room."
Peter Parker,"[Peter looks around] Books. Pictures. [Gwen laughs] Oh, hey, uh...I got your mom these. [he takes out a bunch of broken looking flowers from his backpack]"
Gwen Stacy,"Oh, lovely!"
Peter Parker,"Yeah, theyre beautiful, right?"
Gwen Stacy,Theyre beautiful.
Peter Parker,They were...they were nice.
Gwen Stacy,"No, theyre beautiful."
Peter Parker,Im sorry.
Gwen Stacy,"No, its impressive. Theyre actually held together very well."
Peter Parker,Im gonna keep these. [Gwen smiles] [referring to Peters backpack]
Gwen Stacy,"Do you have your suit in there? [Peter pauses, thinking she means his Spider-Man suit]"
Peter Parker,My suit? 
Gwen Stacy,"For dinner? Are you gonna...are you gonna wear that? Thats um...thats [at that moment Gwens dad, Captain Stacey, walks into her room] You must be Peter."
Gwen Stacy,"Dad, this is Peter."
Peter Parker,"Hi, nice to meet you, sir. [Peter goes to shake Captain Staceys hand][after his argument with Ratha, Connors injects the serum into the stump of his arm, he falls asleep at his desk, and when he wakes his arm has regenerated, he tries to call Ratha]"
Dr. Curt Connors,"Emma, its Curt. Is he there?"
Emma,"Im afraid not, doctor. The cars taking him to the veterans hospital in Brooklyn."
Dr. Curt Connors,"No, no, no! He cant, Emma. You...you have to stop him. He...he..."
Emma,"I would, but I always lose him when hes on the bridge. Ill make sure Dr. Ratha returns your call as soon as possible. [as Connors hangs up the phone he starts to feel strange and falls, he takes a cab to catch up with Ratha, in the cab his skin starts to scale, he yells at the cab drive to drive] [at the dinner table, Peter pokes at his fish with his knife not knowing how to eat it]"
Helen Stacy,"Youre having trouble there, arent you? The head goes on the... Simon, help Gwens friend with the fish. [as Simon starts to help him]"
Peter Parker,"Oh, uh...I got no idea"
Simon Stacy,First time. [Gwen whispers to Peter from across the table]
Gwen Stacy,Branzino.
Helen Stacy,"George, why dont you tell us about your day?"
Howard Stacy,"Oh, yeah, dad. Did you catch that spider guy yet?"
Captain Stacy,"No, we didnt catch, but we will. Hes an amateur, whos assaulting civilians in the dead of night, hes clumsy, he leaves clues, bit still dangerous."
Peter Parker,"Hes as...hes assaulting people? Im not sure. I mean, I saw that video, of him and the car thief and I think most people would say that he was providing a public service."
Captain Stacy,"Most people would be wrong. If I wanted a car thief off the street, hes already be off the street."
Peter Parker,So why wasnt he then? [Gwen laughs awkwardly]
Captain Stacy,"Let me illuminate you. You see, the car thief was leading us to the people who run the entire operation. Its been a six month long sting, its called strategy. Im sure youre aware of the term, strategy? Youve probably heard about that in school?"
Peter Parker,Yeah.
Captain Stacy,Good.
Peter Parker,"Well, obviously he didnt know you had a plan."
Captain Stacy,"You seem to know an awful lot about this case. You know something that we dont know? I mean, whos side are you on here?"
Peter Parker,"Well, Im not on anyones side. I saw a video on the internet..."
Captain Stacy,"Oh! You saw the video on the internet. Well, then the case is closed."
Peter Parker,"Well, no. Im just sayin, if you watch the video, maybe send you a link? It looks like...it looks like hes really trying to help."
Captain Stacy,"Yeah, sure, on the internet hes been made out to look like some kind of masked hero or something."
Peter Parker,"No. No. Im not saying hes a hero, I dont think hes a hero at all."
Captain Stacy,What are you trying to say?
Peter Parker,"Im saying, hes trying to help. But it looks like hes trying to do something that maybe the police cant."
Captain Stacy,Something the police cant?
Peter Parker,I dont know.
Captain Stacy,What do you think we do all day? Think we just sit around eating donuts with our thumbs planted firmly up our asses?
Helen Stacy,George!
Gwen Stacy,Daddy.
Helen Stacy,George.
Peter Parker,Im sorry.
Captain Stacy,Is that what you think we do down there?
Howard Stacy,"Up your what, dad?"
Helen Stacy,Howard!
Peter Parker,"I think he stands for what you stand for, sir. Protecting innocent people from bad guys."
Captain Stacy,"I stand for law and order, son. Thats what I stand for, okay? I wear a badge. This guy wears a mask, like uh...you know, like uh...like an outlaw! Hes hunting down a bunch of criminals that all look the same, like hes got some sort of personal vendetta. But hes not protecting innocent people. Mr. Parker."
Gwen Stacy,"Lets get some air, Peter. [she stands and turns to leave] Dad, we need to talk."
Captain Stacy,"Yes, we do."
Peter Parker,"Thank you for having me. Im sorry if I insulted you, that was not my intention."
Captain Stacy,Youre welcome. [Peter gets up]
Peter Parker,"Branzino was real good, Mrs. Stacy. Thank you."
Helen Stacy,"Youre welcome. [Peter and Gwen leave the room] [after the awkward family dinner, Gwen takes Peter to the roof]"
Gwen Stacy,"Well, that was something."
Peter Parker,[referring to her dad] Im sorry. I thought he was gonna arrest me at one point.
Gwen Stacy,"Nah, I wouldnt have let him arrest you. What happened to your face?"
Peter Parker,I wanna tell you something.
Gwen Stacy,Oh! Okay.
Peter Parker,Ive been bitten.
Gwen Stacy,"So have I. [Gwen gets closer to Peter, but Peter backs off]"
Peter Parker,"Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I gotta tell you this one thing. I gotta tell you this one thing. Its about the vigilante and the car thief, alright? [Gwen looks disappointed]"
Gwen Stacy,Oh! Okay. [Gwen thinks that he wants to talk about her dad]
Peter Parker,"No! No! I dont wanna talk about your dad, I wanna talk about me. Okay?"
Gwen Stacy,What about you?
Peter Parker,I...I wish I could just...I cant! Its hard to say.
Gwen Stacy,Just say.
Peter Parker,No. No.
Gwen Stacy,"Say it. [Peter tries to find the right words to say to tell her the truth about himself] What? What? [he looks at her] What? [Peter shakes his head as he cant find the right words, Gwen frustrated, turns and starts to walk off but Peter stops her with his web-shooter and pulls her into his arms and as Gwen realizes who he is, Peter kisses her] [after Gwen realizes who Peter is, Peter hears police sirens and jumps off the balcony to catch up with the cop cars, Gwen sees this and says to herself] [after Peter finds The Lizard has caused havoc on the bridge, Peter tries to save a boy trapped in a car suspended from the bridge, as he frees the kid from his seatbelt the car lights on fire and Peter manages to hold onto the suspended car]"
Peter Parker,"Jack, climb, now!"
Jack,I cant!
Peter Parker,"Yes, you can! [Peter struggles to hold onto the car] Put...put it on! The mask! Its gonna make you strong. [Jack looks at Peters mask which hed taken off and given to him earlier] Jack, trust me. Put it on. [Jack puts on the mask] There you go! Thats it! Thats it, buddy! Thats it. Okay, now, climb! Come on, Jack! [Jack starts to slowly climb towards Peter] Do me a favor, a little faster. Okay, bud? Youre doing great, buddy. Youre doing great! Thats it, keep coming. Keep it coming. Keep coming. [as Jack gets closer to Peter, he reaches out his hand towards Peter, but the car suddenly drops] No! [Peter quickly catches the boy mid-fall with a web shot and pulls him to safety]"
Jacks Father,Who are you?
Peter Parker,"Spider-Man. [the day after the bridge incident, Stacy addresses the news reporters; Peter watches this on the TV as he eats breakfast]"
Captain Stacy,"At approximately 9 p.m. last night an incident took place on the Williamsburg Bridge. Much of what occurred is really speculation at this point. However, several eye witnesses to the crime as well as our own prepreliminary finding, have positively placed one individual at the scene, which is why this morning Im issuing an arrest warrant for the masked vigilante, known as Spider-Man."

[at school, Peter shows Gwen the spider that bit him]"
Gwen Stacy,Its so beautiful.
Peter Parker,But its got a bite though!
Gwen Stacy,Who else knows about this?
Peter Parker,Just...
Gwen Stacy,Me? [Peter nods his head]
Peter Parker,"You dont...you dont believe what the police are saying, do you?"
Gwen Stacy,"Of course not. Does it scare you, what you can do?"
Peter Parker,No. No.
Gwen Stacy,What did that thing on the bridge look like?
Peter Parker,Real big. Too big to be human.
Gwen Stacy,You gotta lay low.
Peter Parker,"No, cant do that."
Gwen Stacy,"But youve got to. I mean, why?"
Peter Parker,"Cause of last night. Those people on the bridge, whatever is attacking them, when it killed them. So I gotta...I gotta go after it."
Gwen Stacy,But thats not your job.
Peter Parker,Maybe it is. I really liked kissing you. Youre an amazing kisser. [Gwen laughs shyly]
Gwen Stacy,"Well, you know, it was...it was good for me too."
Peter Parker,Yeah?
Gwen Stacy,"Mmhmm. [as Peter leans in to kiss Gwen, he quickly catches the football thats headed towards them and throws it back into the field hitting the football post and everyone on the field watches in amazement] [Peter goes to Connors lab and finds the place looking empty, he picks up the serum injection from Connors desk and as hes looking at it Connors enters the lab]"
Dr. Curt Connors,Its not nice to snoop. I gave everyone the week off.
Peter Parker,Yeah.
Dr. Curt Connors,Shouldnt you be at school?
Peter Parker,"No, I got a...I got a free track. I wanted...I wanted to ask you a question. How would a predator track a reptile?"
Dr. Curt Connors,"Oh, they dont. Most reptiles are at the top of their respective food chain, kings of their domain."
Peter Parker,"But they gotta have vulnerabilities, right?"
Dr. Curt Connors,Why the sudden interest in the cold blooded?
Peter Parker,"Just asking a question. I got...I got...I got school stuff, biology profiles to do. So, because of the cold blood, would they react to sudden changes in temperature?"
Dr. Curt Connors,Youd have to catch one first. Did you know theres a rumor of a new species in New York? Beautiful and quite large.
Peter Parker,What do you know about it? Have you seen it?
Dr. Curt Connors,"Well, its not yet classified. But it can be aggressive, if threatened. [suddenly Connors neck begins to show signs of changing, he turns his face from Peter]"
Peter Parker,"Doc, are you alright?"
Dr. Curt Connors,"Never been better, Peter. Never been better. Now, if youll excuse me, Im afraid Im gonna have to ask you to leave. I have a new project Im working on and I need to be alone. [he opens to door to his lab, Peter nods his head and walks out, Connors walks out with him] Dont worry, Mr. Parker. Ill be back. [he starts to walk off but before he leave he turns to face Peter] Wonderful things are coming. Wonderful things. [Peter looks at Connor suspiciously as he leaves, then Peter turns and sees the test mouse they had injected with the serum has morphed into a lizard mouse and is eating the normal mouse in the next cage] Fred! [Parker goes to Stacys office]"
Captain Stacy,"Mr. Parker, why are you not in school?"
Peter Parker,Got a free track.
Captain Stacy,"Okay. Well I do not have a free track, so make your point quickly."
Peter Parker,"Okay, fine. There may not be a dinosaur running around Manhattan, but there is something more dangerous, and I know who it is."
Captain Stacy,You know who it is?
Peter Parker,"Dr. Curtis Connors, hes a biochemist..."
Captain Stacy,Of OsCorp?
Peter Parker,Thats right.
Captain Stacy,Okay. Dr. Curtis Connors whos also my daughters mentor. Is that who youre talking about?
Peter Parker,Thats the one.
Captain Stacy,"You know, recently Dr. Connors gave Gwen a glowing college recommendation. It was beautiful, when I read it I cried. But you would have me believe that in his spare time hes running around dressed up like a giant dinosaur."
Peter Parker,Not dressing up and not a dinosaur. He has transformed himself into a giant lizard. [Stacy looks at Peter like hes crazy]
Captain Stacy,Let me ask you a question. Do I look like the mayor of Tokyo to you?
Peter Parker,"Im telling you the...Im telling you the absolute truth. This man has worked for his whole life on cross-species genetics. He lost one arm and has been trying to grow it back, but there is something imbalanced by the equation and he has turned into a full lizard. Hes using lizard DNA. He is dangerous! And hes planning something horrific. I know! I know!"
Captain Stacy,"Okay. Alright. I get it. Heres what were gonna do. Youre gonna go back to hanging out with the citizens of Tokyo, and Im gonna go back to protecting the citizens of this fine and fair city of ours. Sergeant Butler, would you please escort Mr. Parker back to school. [Butler starts escorting Parker out]"
Peter Parker,"Captain Stacy, Im not...Im not messing around. Just bring him in, just call him in! You have to call him in! He is a danger to everybody! Just, please, listen to me! [Butler pushes Parker out and as Parker leaves Stacy turns to his colleague]"
Captain Stacy,"Jimmy, give me everything we have on Dr. Curtis Connors. Okay? Right away. [as Peter walks out of the police station, he notices little lizards crawling down into the sewer] [Connors has set up a mini-lab in the sewer and is recording himself on camera]"
Dr. Curt Connors,"Subject; Dr. Curtis Connors. Current temperature; eighty nine point seven, steady for forty eight hours. Blood panels reveal lymphocyte and monocyte readings consistent with subjects past. Clotting rate vastly improved, marked enhancement in...in muscle response, strength and elasticity. [as Connors is testing himself, Peter down the sewer, builds a giant web in the intersection of the tunnels; back at his sewer lab, Connors continues talking into the camera] Eye sight similarly improved. Subject no longer requires corrective lenses. This is no longer about curing ills. This is about finding perfection. In attempt to regress regenerative relapse, dosage has been increased to two hundred milligrams. [he injects himself with the serum and suddenly turns violent and knocks the camera out; we then see that Peter has set up a camera in the sewer tunnel and and lies in his web to wait for Connors] [in the sewer tunnel after Connors has transformed into a giant lizard, he finds Peter and grabs hold of him]"
The Lizard,You stopped me once. You wont stop me again! Im getting stronger everyday! [suddenly they fall through the giant web and fight underwater with Peter escaping through a pipe that the lizard cant follow through]
Spider-Man,"Oh, that sucked! [as Peters camera keeps taking pictures of the lizard, he notices the flash and grabs the camera, he sees that it has the label Property of Peter Parker]"
The Lizard,Peter Parker! [Peter goes to Gwen apartment and knocks on her bedroom window]
Gwen Stacy,"You should maybe uh...consider coming in through the lobby. [they both laugh] Also, my father is under the impression that you require psychiatric attention. [as Peter comes in through the window she notices that hes gashed across the chest from his fight with the lizard]"
Peter Parker,"Oh, really?"
Gwen Stacy,"Peter, what happened?"
Peter Parker,"You should see the other guy. The other guy, in this instance, being a giant mutant lizard. [as Peter is in Gwens room, Gwen hears her dad calling to her]"
Captain Stacy,"Hey, Gwen. Honey, do you want uh...coco? Howards making some coco. [she quickly goes to answer her father and Peter tries to hide]"
Captain Stacy,Okay. I just thought I remembered somebody saying last week that her fantasy was to live in a chocolate house.
Gwen Stacy,"Well, thats impractical. [she shuts her door, then opens it again] And fattening! [she shuts her door again and turns to face Peter, who smiles at her]"
Peter Parker,"Chocolate house? [she rolls her eyes at Peter then opens her door again, Stacy is still outside her door]"
Gwen Stacy,"Sorry, dad. [referring to the coco]"
Captain Stacy,Its good.
Gwen Stacy,"I just, I cant um...have coco right now, because Im working...Im doing this um...I have to...I have cramps."
Captain Stacy,Oh.
Gwen Stacy,"I feel kind of pukey and just sort of, I dont know, emotional. [Stacy looks awkward]"
Captain Stacy,Okay. Good. Good.
Gwen Stacy,"Like I keep crying. Its brutal. You dont wanna know, trust me. Its like, bad!"
Captain Stacy,I got it.
Gwen Stacy,"Thanks, daddy."
Captain Stacy,"Alright. [as Gwen tries to clean his chest wound, Peter tries to kiss her but she stops him]"
Gwen Stacy,I know what this is.
Peter Parker,What is it?
Gwen Stacy,"Everyday, for as long as I can remember, my father has left every morning and put a badge on his chest, and strapped a gun to his hip. And everyday, for as long as I can remember, I havent known if he was gonna make it home."
Peter Parker,"Okay. I gotta stop him though. I have to, because I created him."
Gwen Stacy,What do you mean?
Peter Parker,"I gave him an equation that made all of this possible. Something my father had been working on, secretly. Now I realize why he kept it a secret. Gwen, this is my responsibility. I have to fix it. [back in his sewer lab, Connors has morphed back into his human form and is thinking to himself]"
Dr. Curt Connors,"Peter Parker. Spider-Man! Im not the one who needs help! There will be no more loneliness, no more outcasts. Species wide distribution could enhance humanity on an evolutionary scale. One has to adapt to survive. [he speaks out loud] Without changing likeness I might be free to cast off flesh wherein I dwell confide. [thinks to himself again] Would you give it all up, after all you know you can do? [he then takes the serum and injects himself with a high dosage] I can save them! [Connors starts transforming] Youre not gonna get in the way of my plan, Peter Parker! [the lizard climbs into Peters school bathroom threw the sewers, the kids all run with terror and Peter tells Gwen to run too, and then they start fighting]"
The Lizard,"No where to hide, Peter. [the lizard throws Peter through a wall and he concocts a makeshift bomb with the chemicals in the chemistry lab and throws it through the wall where Peter] [Peter throws one of his shoes at him, then Peter jumps out of the wall dressed in his Spider-Man costume and jumps on top of the lizard]"
Peter Parker,"Youre not thinkin straight, doc! Stop this! This isnt you! [as they continue to fight] Lets talk this out! [as the lizard and Peter continue to fight] Alright, so you dont wanna talk? [Peter throws a shot of web onto the lizards mouth to shut him up] There you go. [the lizard easily gets rid of the web on his mouth, and as Peter grabs hold of his tail, the lizard tries to get Peter off his tail but hitting him hard against the wall several times] Dont...make me...have to...hurt you! [Peter then yanks his tail off and gets thrown to the ground] Ugh! Disgusting! [the lizards tail quickly regrows back as he walks towards Peter and as hes about to tear his head off suddenly Gwen hits him with a trophy]"
The Lizard,"Gwen! [as the lizard turns to Gwen, Peter uses this opportunity to wrap the lizard in web and traps him, he then takes the trophy from Gwen and breaks the window with it, he turns to Gwen]"
Peter Parker,Im gonna throw you out the window now.
Gwen Stacy,What? [he throws her out the window and she swings out the window holding on to one of his webs] [referring to the police sirens that can be heard outside the school grounds]
Peter Parker,"Uh-oh! Someones been a bad lizard! [as they fight they crash through the library wall, we see a man (Stan Lee) in the library listening to music on headphones and totally unaware of the events going on behind him as Peter and the lizard keep on fighting] [after the school attack, Gwen call Peter as hes tracking the lizard in the sewer] Hey."
Peter Parker,Hey.
Gwen Stacy,Where are you?
Peter Parker,"Im fine. Im okay. Im down the sewer, Im tracking him. I gotta stop him before anyone gets hurt, but we need antidote. Do you know how to run a serum?"
Gwen Stacy,"Yeah, I do it at OsCorp all the time."
Peter Parker,"Okay. Great. Great. Great. Okay. Listen, I need you to OsCorp, I need you to access the cross-species file. Its a blue serum, vile, 1-2-3-8-9."
Gwen Stacy,"Okay, got it. On my way. [Peter finds Connors lab in the sewer and turns on his computer which has Connors recordings of himself]"
Dr. Curt Connors,"I spent my life as a scientist trying to create a world without weakness, without outcasts. I sought to create a stronger human being, but theres no such thing. Human beings are weak, pathetic, feeble minded creatures. Why be human at all when we can be so much more? Faster, stronger, smarter! This is my gift to you. [as Peter listens to Connors on the computer he looks around and finds Connors plans to use the use the old cloud machine at OsCorp to disperse a cloud of serum across the city, turning everybody into lizards] [as Stacy gets onto a helicopter to find the lizard]"
Officer,The lizards headed toward Canal Street Station.
Captain Stacy,What about Spider-Man?
Officer,Hes inside the high school.
Captain Stacy,"I want that Spider-Man off the street. [in the helicopter, Stacy listens to radio as the officer updates him]"
Officers Voice,"The lizard creature has released a biological agent. All efforts at stopping him have failed and he is now proceeding north on 7th Avenue. [after finding out Connors plans, Peter calls Gwen]"
Peter Parker,"Hey, where are you?"
Gwen Stacy,Im in OsCorp.
Peter Parker,"You have to get out of there right now, okay?"
Gwen Stacy,The antidote is cooking.
Peter Parker,"No, no, no! Connors is on the way. Hes coming to you right now. He means to disperse them with the device, hes gonna infect the whole city!"
Gwen Stacy,Theres eight minutes left.
Peter Parker,"Youre gonna wait there for eight minutes after what I just told you? People are gonna die! You leave right now! Listen, that is an order! Okay?"
Gwen Stacy,Im gonna get everybody out.
Peter Parker,"Did you hear what...? Gwen! Gwen? You mother hubbard! Are you serious?! [as Peter is rushing to OsCorp the police capture him with a stun-gun bullet and Peter falls to the ground, as they handcuff him and Stacy pulls off his mask, Peter breaks free and fights off the police officers, but Stacy pulls his gun and shouts out]"
Captain Stacy,"Freeze! Down on the ground! Put your hands behind your head! Now! [the police light shines on Peter as hes forced to turn around, revealing his face] Parker!"
Peter Parker,"Its headed to OsCorp, and youre daughters there right now. [he slowly walks towards Stacy] You gotta let me go. [Peter kneels to pick up his mask, puts it on and runs off, the police start shooting at him]"
Captain Stacy,"Hold your fire! [as Peter is swinging away, he gets shot in the leg and slows him down as hes trying to get to OsCorp, the man whose son Peter saved on the bridge sees him struggling on the TV and organizes his construction workers to turn their cranes to form a framework on which Peter can swing to OsCorp] [Stacy arrives just as as Gwen runs out of OsCorp building with the antidote]"
Gwen Stacy,Dad! I have got to get this to Spider-Man.
Captain Stacy,"Get in the car, lets go."
Gwen Stacy,"No! No, no, no! I can stop the lizard!"
Captain Stacy,Get in the car.
Gwen Stacy,You dont understand!
Captain Stacy,"I do. Youre boyfriend is a man of many masks, I get it. [he takes the antidote in Gwens hand] Give me this. Get in the car."
Gwen Stacy,"Please make sure hes okay. [as the lizard has set up the cloud machine on top of OsCorp building to detonate the serum in two minutes, Peter shows up and they start fighting, the lizard then gets hold of Peter, smashes Peters mechanical web slingers, rips his mask off and starts to strangle him]"
The Lizard,"Poor, Peter Parker. No mother. No father. No uncle. All alone. [suddenly they hear the sound of a shotgun cocking]"
Captain Stacy,"Hes not alone! [Stacy is behind them, he shoots at a tank of liquid nitrogen, Peter then freezes the lizard to slow its regeneration while Stacy shoots it with his shotgun making the lizard fall into the tank] Hey, gift from Gwen! [Stacy gives Peter the antidote] I got this, Peter! Go! [as Peter sets off to get to the cloud machine, the lizard breaks out of the liquid nitrogen ice coating and impales Stacy with its claws] [as the lizard chases to stop Peter, Peter manages to swap the serum with the antidote, it explodes into a giant cloud over the city and hits the lizard, turning him back to his human form, as the pinnacle Peter is on breaks off from the liquid nitrogen spillage, Peter falls but hes saved by Connors grabbing him and pulling him to safety]"
Dr. Curt Connors,"The Captain! [Peter runs over to Stacy, who is gravely wounded]"
Peter Parker,Captain!
Captain Stacy,The lizard?
Peter Parker,"Its okay. We stopped him. Lets get you out of here. [Stacy winces in pain as Peter tries to move him] Look at me. Youre gonna stay with me. Helps on the way, okay?"
Captain Stacy,You need to...you need to be gone when they...when they get here. Okay?
Peter Parker,Im not going anywhere.
Captain Stacy,"I was wrong about you, Peter. The city needs you. Here. [he holds out Peters mask] Youre gonna need this. [Peter takes his mask] Youre gonna make enemies, people will get hurt. Sometimes people closest to you. So I want you to promise me something, okay? [Peter nods his head] Leave Gwen out of it. Promise me that. [Peter looks down] Huh? You promise me. [Peter reluctantly nods his head]"
Peter Parker,"Yes. [Stacy closes his eyes as he dies, Peter cries and looks out at the city] [a newscaster on TV reports the aftermath of the events]"
TV Newscaster,"An eerie calm has set in over New York city. Apparently some sort of aerosolized antidote was launched from OsCorp Tower, which seems to have counteracted the biotoxins. Residents of lower Manhattan can rest peacefully, knowing that the alleged mastermind of this terror plot, Dr. Curtis Connors is behind bars. [Peter returns home to Aunt May, shes shocked to see him looking beaten and bruised, Peter pulls a carton of eggs out of his backpack and hands them to her, she hugs him]"
Aunt May,Sweetheart. Its okay. Its alright. Its alright.
Peter Parker,Rough night.
Aunt May,"Its gonna be alright. [at Stacys funeral, Peter hides on the roof of a building nearby and watches from a distance, Gwen senses him and looks up but sees nothing, later she then turns up at his house]"
Gwen Stacy,Where have you been?
Peter Parker,"I... [he looks away not answering, Gwen starts crying]"
Gwen Stacy,"My father died. There was a funeral. They shot off rifles and they made speeches. Two of my teachers showed up, and Flash showed up. Everyone was there but you. [Peter wipes away a tear from her face, but then stops and looks away]"
Peter Parker,I cant do this. I cant do this. Im sorry.
Gwen Stacy,What are you saying?
Peter Parker,"I cant see you anymore. I cant! [Gwen looking upset, turns starts walking away, she then stops and turns to face him]"
Gwen Stacy,"He made you promise, didnt he? To stay away from me? So Id be safe. [Peter doesnt answer and Gwen walks off] [after Gwen leaves, Peter returns inside]"
Aunt May,What a pretty girl.
Peter Parker,Yeah. Thats what Uncle Ben said.
Aunt May,Did you ask her out? [Peter shakes his head] Why?
Peter Parker,I cant.
Aunt May,Why?
Peter Parker,Im just no good for her.
Aunt May,"Peter Parker, if theres one thing you are, its good. Anyone has a problem with that can talk to me. [Peter listens to the voice message that his uncle left him before he died]"
Uncle Ben,"Peter, I know things have been difficult lately. And Im sorry about that. I think I know what youre feeling. Ever since you were a little boy, youve been living with so many unresolved things. Well, take it from old man, those things send us down a road, they make us who we are.
