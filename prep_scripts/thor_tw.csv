jane foster,wait for it.
darcy lewis,can i turn on the radio?
jane foster,no!
erik selvig,"jane, you cant keep doing this."
jane foster,the last seventeen occurrences had been predictable to this second! [she checks through her notebook]
erik selvig,"jane, youre an astrophysicist, not some storm chaser!"
jane foster,"im telling you, theres a connection between these atmosphere disturbances and my research. eric, i...i wouldnt ask you to fly out here if i wasnt absolutely sure. [going onto the roof of their vehicle to get a clearer look] god!"
erik selvig,i thought you said it was a subtle aurora!
jane foster,[to darcy] go!
narrator,darcy suddenly starts the car and speeds towards the light
jane foster,[to the body thats just dropped to the ground from the sky] do me a favor and dont be dead! please! [looking up at the sky] where did he come from?
odin,[voice over] once mankind accepted a simple truth; that they were not alone in this universe. some worlds man believed home to their gods. others they new to fear. from around the cold and darkness came the frost giants. threatening to plunge the mortal world into a new ice age.
narrator,humans are attacked and frozen by frost giants
odin,[voice over] but humanity would not face this threat alone.
narrator,asgardians led by odin arrive on jotunheim
odin,"{voice over] our armies drove the frost giants back into the heart of their own world. the cost was great. in the end, their king fell. and the source of their power was taken from them."

narrator,asgard is shown
odin,"[voice over] with the last great war ended, we withdrew from the other worlds and returned home at the realm eternal, asgard. and here we remain as the beacon of hope. shining out across the stars. and though we have fallen into mans myths and legends, it was asgard and its warriors that brought peace to the universe."
narrator,"odin, young thor, and young loki are walking through the treasure vault"
odin,but the day will come when one of you will have to defend that peace.
young loki,do the frost giants still live?
young thor,"when im king, ill hunt the monsters down and slay them all! just as you did, father."
odin,"a wise king, never seeks out war. but...he must always be ready for it. [he walks away and the boys run to catch up with him]"
young thor,"im ready, father."
young loki,so am i!
odin,only one of you can ascend to the throne. but both of you were born to be kings!
narrator,at thors coronation
odin,"thor odinson, my heir, my first born. so long entrusted with the mighty hammer, mjöllnir, forged in the heart of a dying star. its power has no equal! its a weapon to destroy or as a tool to build. it is a fit companion for a king. i have defended asgard, and the lives of the innocent across my realms in the time of the great beginning."
narrator,"during thors coronation, frost giant freeze pillars in the vault"
odin,do you swear to guard the nine realms?
thor,i swear.
odin,and do you swear to preserve the peace?
thor,i swear.
odin,do you swear to cast aside your selfish ambition and to pledge yourself only to the good of the realms?
thor,i swear!
odin,"and on this day, i odin, all-father, will proclaim you... [after finding out the frost giants have broke into their weapons vault]"
narrator,the frost giants steal take out the guards
odin,frost giants.
narrator,the frost giants take the casket of ancient winters
narrator,odin hits his spear against the floor which echoes
narrator,"in the vault, the destroyer comes out of its room and takes out the frost giants, takes back the casket, sets it back in its original place, and enters its room again"
narrator,"thor, odin, and loki have entered the vault"
thor,the jotuns must pay for what theyve done!
odin,"they have paid. with their lives. to destroy it at its work, the casket is safe and all is well."
thor,all is well? they broke into the weapons vault! if the frost giants have stolen even one of these relics...
odin,they didnt!
thor,well i want to know why?
odin,"i have a truce with laufey, king of the jotuns."
thor,he just broke your truce! they know you are vulnerable.
odin,what action would you take?
thor,march into jotunheim as you once did. teach them a lesson. break their spirits so theyll never dare to cross our borders again.
odin,youre thinking only as a warrior.
thor,"well, this was an act of war!"
odin,"it was the act of but a few, doomed to fail."
thor,look at how far they got!
odin,we will find the breach in our defenses and it will be sealed.
thor,as king of asgard...
odin,but youre not king! not yet.
narrator,thor is then seen flipping banquet tables and sits down on a step
narrator,loki rounds the corner to join him
thor,"its unwise to be in my company now, brother. this was to be my day of triumph."
loki,"itll come. in time. if its any consolation, i think youre right. about the frost giants, about laufey, about everything. if they found a way to penetrate asgards defenses once, whos to say they wont try again. next time with an army."
thor,exactly!
loki,theres nothing you can do without defying father.
narrator,"volstagg, frandral, hogun, and sif walk in"
volstagg,what happened in here?
loki,theres nothing you can do without defying father.
narrator,thor gives him a knowing look
loki,"no! no, no, no, no, no! i know that look!"
thor,its the only way to ensure the safety of our borders!
loki,"thor, its madness!"
volstagg,madness? what sort of madness?
thor,were going to jotunheim.
fandral,"what? this isnt like a journey to earth, where you summon a little lightning and thunder, the mortals worship you as a god! this is jotunheim."
thor,my father fought his way into jotunheim. defeated their armies and took their casket! we would just be looking for answers.
sif,it is forbidden!
thor,"my friends, have you forgotten all that we have done together? fandral, hogun, who led you into the most glorious battles?"
hogun,you did.
thor,"and volstagg, to delicacies so succulent you though youd died and gone to valhalla?"
volstagg,you did.
thor,yes! and who proved wrong all who scoffed at the idea that a young maiden could be one of the fiercest warriors this realm has ever known?
sif,i did!
thor,"true, but i supported you, sif."
narrator,he turns to look at all of the
thor,"my friends, were going to jotunheim."
narrator,they are seen riding to the bifrost
loki,good heimdall?
heimdall,youre not dressed warmly enough. do you think that you can deceive me?
loki,you must be mistaken...
thor,"enough! heimdall, may we pass?"
heimdall,never has an enemy slipped my watch until this day. i wish to know how that happened?
thor,then tell no one where we have gone until weve returned. understand?
narrator,"thor walks passed heimdall, the others follow behind and volstagg turns to loki"
volstagg,what happened? silver tongue turned to lead?
narrator,the others laugh
heimdall,"be warned. i will honor my sworn oath to protect this realm as its gatekeeper. if you return threatens the safety of asgard by frost, will remain closed to you. and youll be left to die in the cold waste of jotunheim."
volstagg,couldnt you just leave the bridge open for us?
heimdall,"to leave the bridge open would unleash the full power of the bifrost and destroy jotunheim, and with you upon it."
thor,i have no plans to die today.
heimdall,none do.
narrator,heimdall sends them to jotunheim
narrator,as they enter jotunheim
king laufey,"you have come a long way to die, asgardians?"
thor,i am thor odinson.
king laufey,we know who you are.
thor,how did your people get into asgard?
king laufey,the house of odin is full of traitors.
thor,do not dishonor my fathers name with your lies!
king laufey,your father is a murderer and a thief! and why have you come here? to make peace? you long for battle. you crave it! youre nothing but a boy trying to prove himself a man.
thor,well this boy has grown tired of your mockery.
loki,"thor, stop and think! look around you. were out numbered!"
thor,"know your place, brother!"
king laufey,"you know not what your actions would unleash. i do. go, now! while i still allow it."
narrator,he comes walks closer to thor and loki
loki,"we will accept, your most gracious offer."
narrator,"thor looks at laufey, reluctant to leave"
loki,"come on, brother!"
narrator,as thor reluctantly turns to leave the frost giant
frost giant sentry,"[mocking] run back home, little princess."
loki,damn!
narrator,thors hammer extends and he hits the frost giant with it and their battle begins
narrator,just as the frost giants have cornered thor and his friends odin appears
thor,father! lets finish them together!
odin,silence!
narrator,king laufey suddenly extends in front of odin
king laufey,all-father. you look weary.
odin,"laufey, end this now."
king laufey,your boy sought this out.
odin,"youre right. these are the actions of a boy. treat them as such. you and i can end this, here and no. before theres further bloodshed."
king laufey,"we are beyond diplomacy now, all-father. hell get what he came for. war and death."
odin,so be it.
narrator,laufeys icy armor extends and he hits odin off his horse
thor,why did you bring us back?
odin,do you realize what youve done? what youve started?
thor,i was protecting my home!
odin,you cannot even protect your friends! how can you hope to protect a kingdom?
thor,there wont be a kingdom to protect if we are afraid to act! the jotuns must learn to fear me! just as they once feared you.
odin,"thats pride and vanity talking, not leadership. youve forgotten everything i taught you! about a warriors patience."
thor,"while you wait and be patient, the nine realms laugh at us! the old ways are done! youd stand giving speeches while asgard falls!"
odin,"[shouting] you are a vain, greedy, cruel boy!"
thor,[shouting] and you are an old man and a fool!
odin,"yes, i was a fool. to think you were ready."
loki,father...
odin,"[shouts at loki] nay! thor odinson, you have betrayed the express command of your king. through your arrogance and stupidity, you have opened these peaceful realms and innocent lives to the horror and desolation of war!"
narrator,he steps forward to stand in front of thor
odin,you are unworthy of these realms! you are unworthy of your title!
narrator,he strips him of his medals and cape
odin,"youre unworthy...of the loved ones you have betrayed. i now take from you, youre power!"
narrator,he takes thors hammer
odin,in the name of my father!
narrator,with thors hammer he destroys the shield on one of thors arm
odin,and his father.
narrator,use the hammer to destroy another one of thors shields
odin,"i, odin, all-father, curse you out!"
narrator,with thors hammer he banishes thor out of asgard after hes just banished thor
odin,"whosoever holds of this hammer, if you be worthy, you posses the power of thor."
narrator,he throws thors hammer out of asgard
narrator,after thor has crash landed onto their truck and is lying wounded on the ground
darcy lewis,whoa! does he need cpr? cause i totally know cpr.
narrator,thor looks and jane
jane foster,where did he come from? you all right?
narrator,thor gets up from the ground
thor,hammer? hammer?!
darcy lewis,"yeah, we can tell youre hammered! thats pretty obvious."
erik selvig,"jane, well have to take him to the hospital."
thor,father!
jane foster,he is fine! look at him.
thor,heimdall? i know you can hear me! open the bifrost!
jane foster,"[to erik, as they watch thor] hospital! you go. ill stay."
thor,you? what realm is this? Álfheimr? niflheimr?
darcy lewis,new mexico!
narrator,darcy hold her taser gun at him
thor,"you dare threaten me, thor! youre so puny..."
narrator,"darcy shoots him with her taser gun. he shakes and falls, erik and jane look at darcy in shock"
darcy lewis,what? he was freaking me out!
narrator,the screen shows darcy and erik putting him in the car
erik selvig,"darcy, next time you taze somebody, make sure theyre in the car first, okay?"
narrator,at county hospital
admission nurse,name?
jane foster,"he said, it was, thor."
narrator,she spells out his name as she types on her computer
admission nurse,t-h-o-r. and your relationship to him?
jane foster,ive never met him before.
darcy lewis,until she hit him with her car.
jane foster,i grazed him. but she tasered him.
darcy lewis,"yes, i did."
narrator,meanwhile in room thor is in
erik selvig,"you dont think this was just a magnetic storm, do you?"
jane foster,"look? the lensing round these edges, its characteristics of an einstein-rosen bridge."
darcy lewis,a what?
erik selvig,[to darcy] i thought you were a science major.
darcy lewis,political science.
jane foster,she was the only applicant.
erik selvig,"[to darcy] an einstein-rosen bridge, is a theoretical connection between two different points in space..."
jane foster,a wormhole.
darcy lewis,hmmm.
jane foster,"erik, look? what do you see? [hands him a photo]"
erik selvig,stars.
jane foster,"yeah. but not our stars! see, this is the star alignment for our quadrant at this time of year. and unless some minor decided to take a day off, these are someone elses constellations."
darcy lewis,"uh, guys, you might wanna see this."
narrator,they walk over and see a picture of what appears to be thor in a cloud
jane foster,i just lost my most important piece of evidence. typical!
darcy lewis,now what?
jane foster,we find him.
erik selvig,[referring to what thor had done to the hospital as hed escaped] did you see what he did in there? im not sure finding him is the best idea.
jane foster,"well, our data cant tell us what it was like to be inside that event and he can. so, were gonna find him."
darcy lewis,okay.
erik selvig,youre gonna look all over new mexico then?
narrator,she starts her car
jane foster,exactly!
narrator,"just as shes reversing her car, thor appears behind her car and she hits him, she rushes out to see him"
jane foster,im so sorry! i swear im not doing this on purpose!
darcy lewis,"[watching as thor get dressed] you know, for a crazy, homeless person, hes pretty cut. sorry, i tased you!"
thor,[pointing to the name tag on the shirt hes about to put on] what is this?
jane foster,oh!
narrator,she takes off the name tag from the t-shirt
jane foster,my ex! good with patience and bad with relationships! uh...theyre the only clothes i had that would fit you.
thor,they will suffice.
narrator,he walks away from her
jane foster,youre welcome!
thor,this mortal form has grown weak. i need sustenance!
volstagg,we should have never let him go!
sif,there was no stopping him.
fandral,"at least hes been banished, not dead. which is what wed all be if that guard hadnt told them where wed gone."
volstagg,how did the guard even know?
loki,i told him.
fandral,what?
loki,i told him to go to odin after wed left. he should be flogged for taking so long. we should have never reached jotunheim.
volstagg,you told the guard?!
loki,i saved our lives. and thors. i had no idea father would banish him for what he did.
sif,"loki, you must go to the all-father and convince him to change his mind."
loki,"and if i do, then what? i love thor more dearly than any of you, but you know what he is. hes arrogant, hes reckless, hes dangerous! you saw how he was today. is that what asgard needs from its king?"
narrator,he walks off
sif,"[referring to loki] he may speak for the good of asgard, but hes always been jealous of thor."
volstagg,we should be grateful to him. he saved our lives.
hogun,laufey said there were traitors in the house of odin. a master of magic could bring three jotuns into asgard.
fandral,"loki has always been one for mischief, but youre talking about something else entirely."
loki,am i cursed?
odin,no.
loki,what am i?
odin,youre my son.
loki,what more than that?
narrator,he walks towards odin
loki,"the casket wasnt the only thing you took from jotunheim that day, was it?"
odin,"no. in the aftermath of the battle, i went into the temple, and i found a baby. small for a giants offspring. abandoned. suffering. left to die. laufeys son."
loki,laufeys son?
odin,yes.
narrator,after finding out hes laufeys son
loki,why? you were knee deep in jotun blood. why would you take me?
odin,you were an innocent child.
loki,no! you took me for a purpose. what was it?
narrator,odin does not reply
loki,[shouting] tell me?!
odin,"i thought we could unite our kingdoms one day. bring about an alliance. bring about permanent peace, through you."
loki,what?
odin,but those plans no longer matter.
loki,"so, im no more than another stolen relic? locked up, here, until you might have use of me!"
odin,why do you twist my words?
loki,"you could have told me what i was, from the beginning! why didnt you?"
odin,youre my son. i wanted only to protect you from the truth.
loki,what? because i...i...i...im the monster that parents tell their children about at night?
odin,no! no!
loki,"it all makes sense now. why you favored thor, all these years! because no matter how much you claim to love me, you could never have a frost giant sitting on your throne of asgard!"
narrator,"as loki is shouting at him odin slowly falls down, loki realizes odin has fallen ill"
loki,"guards! guards, please help!"
narrator,as thor is stuffing his face with food
jane foster,howd you get inside that cloud?
darcy lewis,also how could you eat an entire box of pop tarts and still be this hungry? [thor doesnt reply instead finishes chewing and drink his coffee]
thor,"this drink, i like it!"
darcy lewis,"i know, its great, right?"
narrator,thor suddenly throws his coffee cup to the ground shattering the mug
thor,another!
narrator,after thor has smashed his coffee cup in the diner
jane foster,what was that?
thor,it was delicious! i want another.
jane foster,"well, you could have just said so!"
thor,i just did.
jane foster,no. i mean ask nicely!
thor,i meant no disrespect.
jane foster,"all right. well, no more smashing. deal?"
thor,you have my word.
jane foster,good.
darcy lewis,"oh, my god! this is goin on facebook. [to thor] smile?"
narrator,thor smiles as darcy holds up her cell phone to take his picture
narrator,as thor sets out to get his hammer
jane foster,where you going?
thor,fifty miles west of here.
jane foster,why?
thor,to get what belongs to me.
jane foster,"oh, so you own a satellite now?"
thor,its not what they say it is.
jane foster,"well, what ever it is, the government seems to think its theirs. so you just intend to go in there and take it?"
thor,"yes. if you take me there now, ill tell you everything you wish to know."
jane foster,everything?
thor,"yes. all the answers you seek will be yours, once i reclaim mjöllnir."
darcy lewis,meowmeow? whats meowmeow?
erik selvig,"please, dont do this."
jane foster,you saw what i saw last night. this is no coincidence. we have to find out whats on that crater.
erik selvig,but im not talking about the crater. im talking about him.
jane foster,but hes promising us answers.
erik selvig,"hes delusional. listen to what hes saying. hes talking about mjöllnir, and thor and bifrost! its the stories i grew up with as a child."
jane foster,im just gonna drive him. thats it!
erik selvig,"hes dangerous, jane."
jane foster,im sorry. but i cant take you.
thor,then this is where we say goodbye.
narrator,he takes her hand and kisses it
jane foster,uh...thank you!
thor,jane foster. erik selvig. darcy. farewell.
narrator,after the shields agents have taken all her equipment
jane foster,years of research. gone.
darcy lewis,they even took my ipod.
erik selvig,what about the backups?
jane foster,they took our backups. they took the backups of our backups. they were extremely thorough.
darcy lewis,just downloaded like thirty songs onto there.
jane foster,"could you please, stop with your ipod!"
sif,"all-father, we must speak with you urgently!"
narrator,they suddenly see loki sitting in odins throne
loki,my friends.
fandral,wheres odin?
loki,father has fallen into the odinsleep. mother fears he may never awaken again.
sif,we would speak with her.
loki,she has refused to leave my fathers bedside. you can bring your urgent matter to me.
narrator,he stands
loki,your king.
narrator,they bow
sif,"my king, we would ask that you end thors banishment."
loki,my first command cannot be to undo the all-fathers last. were on the brink of war with jotunheim. our people need a sense of continuity in order to feel safe in these difficult times. all of us must stand together. for the good of asgard.
narrator,"sif stands to say something, but fandral stops her"
fandral,"yes, of course."
loki,good. you then awaiten for my word.
volstagg,"if i may, beg the indulgence of your majesty to perhaps reconsider..."
loki,were done!
narrator,walking into a pet shop
thor,i need a horse!
pet store clerk,"we dont have horses. just dogs, cats, birds."
thor,then give me one of those large enough to ride. [as jane is taking thor to get his hammer]
jane foster,ive never done anything like this before. have you ever done anything like this before?
thor,many times. but youre brave to do it.
jane foster,"well, they just stole my entire lifes work. i didnt really have much left to lose."
thor,but youre clever.
jane foster,thanks.
thor,far more clever than anyone else on this realm.
jane foster,realm? realm?
thor,you think me strange?
jane foster,"yeah, i do!"
thor,"good strange, or bad strange?"
jane foster,im not quite sure yet. but who are you? really?
thor,youll see soon enough.
jane foster,you promised me answers.
thor,"what you seek, its a bridge."
jane foster,like an einstein-rosen bridge?
thor,more like a rainbow bridge.
jane foster,"god, i hope youre not crazy! [as they watch odin sleep]"
loki,i never get used to seeing him like this.
frigga,he has put it off for so long now. but i fear.
loki,how long will it last?
frigga,i dont know. this time its different. we were unprepared.
loki,so why did he lie?
frigga,"he kept the truth from you, so that you would never feel different. you are our son, loki. and we your family. we mustnt lose hope that your father will return to us. and your brother."
loki,what hope is there for thor?
frigga,theres always a purpose to everything your father does.
thor,"now stay here. once i have mjöllnir, i will return the items theyve stolen from you. deal?"
jane foster,"no. look whats down there? you think youre just gonna walk in, grab our stuff, and walk out?"
thor,no. im gonna fly out. [he leaves her] [after thor was caught by the shield agents when he failed to get his hammer]
erik selvig,he committed a crime! hes in jail!
jane foster,i cant just leave him there!
erik selvig,why?
jane foster,you didnt see what i saw!
darcy lewis,look! look! its meowmeo. [she shows the picture of mjöllnir from the book]
jane foster,whered you find this?
erik selvig,the childrens section. i just wanted to show you how silly his story was.
jane foster,"but youre the one whos always pushing me to chase down every possibility, every alternative!"
erik selvig,"im talking about science, not magic!"
jane foster,well magics just science that we dont understand yet; arthur c. clarke.
erik selvig,who wrote science fiction.
jane foster,a precursor to science fact!
erik selvig,"in some cases, yes."
jane foster,"well, if there is an einstein-rosen bridge, then theres something on the other side. and advanced being could have crossed it!"
erik selvig,"oh, jane."
agent coulson,"[interrogating thor] you made my men, some of the most highly trained professionals in the world, look like a bunch of minimum wage mall cops. thats hurtful. in my experience it takes someone whos received similar training to do what you did to them. why dont you tell me where you received your training? pakistan? chechnya? afghanistan? [thor just sits silently staring ahead] you know, you strike me more as the soldier of fortune type. where was it? south africa? certain groups pay very well for a mercenary like you. who are you? [thor just looks at him silently] one way or another well find out what we need to know. were good at that. [his beeper goes off] dont go anywhere. [he leaves the room] [loki appears in front of thor in the interrogation room]"
thor,"loki, what are you doing here?"
loki,i had to see you.
thor,whats happened? tell me? is it jotunheim? let me explain to father.
loki,father is dead.
thor,[in shock] what?
loki,"youre banishment. the threat of a new war. it was too much for him to bear. you mustnt blame yourself. i know that you loved him. i tried to tell him so, but he wouldnt listen. so cruel to put the hammer within your reach, knowing that you could never lift it. the burden of the throne has fallen to me now."
thor,can i come home?
loki,the truce with jotunheim is conditional upon your exile.
thor,"yes, but...couldnt we find a way to..."
loki,"your mother has forbidden your return. this is goodbye, brother. im so sorry."
thor,no. i...i am sorry. thank you for coming here.
loki,farewell. [he turns and leaves just as agent coulson enters the room again]
thor,goodbye.
agent coulson,goodbye? i just got back. his name is donald blake?
erik selvig,doctor donald blake.
agent coulson,"you have dangerous co-workers, doctor selvig."
erik selvig,"he was distraught when he found out that youd taken all of our research. that was years of his life, gone! you can understand how a man can go off like that. a big faceless organization like yours, coming in with their jackbooted thugs and... [coulson gives erik a look] thats how he put it."
agent coulson,that still doesnt explain how he managed to tear through our security.
erik selvig,steroids! hes a bit if a fitness nut.
agent coulson,[looking at the screen with thors picture on donald blakes id card] it says here that he was an md.
erik selvig,"well, he is! or he...he was. he switched careers and became a physicist. a b..b...brilliant physicist. hes a...hes a wonderful man. hes a man in pain."
thor,"you know, i had it all backwards. i had it all wrong."
erik selvig,"was that a bad thing, finding out that you dont have all the answers? you start asking the right questions."
thor,"for the first time in...in my life, i have no idea what im supposed to do."
erik selvig,"if anyone is ever going to find his way in this world, you have to start by getting it that he doesnt know where the hell he is."
thor,"thank you, for what youve done."
erik selvig,dont thank me. i only did it for jane. her father and i taught at university together. he was a good man. he never listened.
thor,neither did i. my father was trying to teach me something. but i was too stupid to see it.
erik selvig,i dont know if youre delusional or if youre putting some kind of con. i dont care. just care about her. ive seen the way she looks at you.
thor,"i swear to you, i...i mean her no harm."
erik selvig,"good. in that case, ill buy you another round. and you leave town tonight. [thor nods his head]"
king laufey,[to his frost giant guards as loki walks up to him] kill him.
loki,after all ive done for you?
king laufey,so youre the one who showed us the way into asgard.
loki,that was just a bit of fun really. to ruin my brothers big day. and to protect the realm from his idiotic rule for a while longer.
king laufey,i will hear you.
loki,"i will conceal you and a handfold of your soldiers, lead you into odins chambers and you can slay him where he lies."
king laufey,why not kill him yourself?
loki,i suspect that the asgardians would not take kindly to a king who had murdered his predecessor. once odin is dead i will return the casket to you. and you can return jotunheim to all its uh...glory.
king laufey,i...accept.
loki,[after hes returned from seeing king laufey in jotunheim] what troubles you gatekeeper?
heimdall,i turned my gaze upon you in jotunheim but could neither see you or hear you.
loki,you were shrouded from me like the frost giants had entered this realm. perhaps your senses have weakened after your many years of service.
heimdall,or perhaps someone has found a way to hide that which he does not wish me to see.
loki,"you have great power, heimdall. did odin ever fear you?"
heimdall,no.
loki,and why is that?
heimdall,because he is my king. and im sworn to obey him.
loki,he was your king. and you are sworn to obey me now. yes? [heimdall give him a long look]
heimdall,yes.
loki,then youll open the bifrost to no one. until i have repaired the damage that my brother has done.
jane foster,"[sitting around a camp fire] i come up here sometimes when i cant sleep, or when im trying to reconcile particle data or when darcys driving me crazy. i come up here a lot actually, now that i think about it. im really glad youre safe."
thor,youve been very kind to me. i...i have been far less grateful than you deserve.
jane foster,"well, i hit you with my car a couple times, so i think that kind of even things out."
thor,perhaps i had it coming. [he returns her research notebook to her] whats wrong?
jane foster,"shield, whatever they are, theyre doing everything in their power to make sure this research never sees the light of day."
thor,"no, jane. listen to me, you must not give up. you must finish what you started."
jane foster,why?
thor,"because youre right. here, look? [he takes her notebook and opens it] youre ancestors called it magic, and you call it science. well, i come form a place where theyre one and the same thing."
jane foster,[watching as he draws in her notebook] what is that?
thor,"my father explained it to me like this, that your world is one of the nine realms of the cosmos. linked to each other by the branches of yggdrasil. the worlds tree. now you see it everyday without realizing. the images glimpsed through uh...what did you call it? this...uh this hooble telescope."
jane foster,hubble.
thor,hubble telescope. [they both laugh]
jane foster,tell me more.
thor,"so the nine realms. now there is midgard, which is earth. theres alfheimr, vanaheimr, jotunheim and asgard. and thats were i come from."
fandral,"our dearest friend banished. loki on the throne. asgard on the brink of war. yet youve managed to consume four wild boar, six pheasants, a side of beef and two casks of ale! shame on you! dont you care! [he throws his drink]"
volstagg,[shouting] do not mistake my appetite for apathy!
sif,stop it! both of you! stop. [pushes fandral away from volstagg] we all know what we have to do.
hogun,we must go. we must find thor.
fandral,its treason.
volstagg,to hell with treason. its suicide.
sif,thor would do the same for us.
volstagg,shush! heimdall might be watching.
heimdall,"you would defy the commands of loki, our king? break every oath you have taken as warriors, and commit treason to bring thor back?"
sif,yes.
heimdall,good!
sif,so youll help us?
heimdall,[as he walks away from them] i am bound by honor to our king. i cannot open the bridge to you.
fandral,"complicated fellow, isnt he?"
volstagg,now what do we do?
sif,look! [they notice the bridge opening]
erik selvig,"its a beautiful theory, jane. you wont be able to convince the scientific community of any of it. not without hard evidence. [just then volstagg knocks on the glass door and beside him are fandral, sif and hogun]"
volstagg,"found you! [thor looks up. jane, darcy and erik are silent in shock, erik drops his coffee cup]"
thor,my friends! [they all enter and thor hugs volstagg]
volstagg,this is good! this is good!
erik selvig,i dont believe it!
volstagg,"oh, excuse me. lady sif, and the warriors three."
thor,"my friends, i have never been happier to anyone. but you should not have come."
fandral,were here to take you home!
thor,you know i cant go home. my father is...dead because of me. i must remain in exile.
sif,"thor, your father still lives."
heimdall,"tell me, loki, how did you get the jotuns into asgard?"
loki,"you think the bifrost is the only way in and out of this realm? there are secret paths between the worlds, to which, even you with all your gifts are blind. but i have need of them no longer, now that i am king. and i say that for your act of treason, you are relieved of your duties as gatekeeper and no longer citizen of asgard."
heimdall,[he suddenly draws his sword and loki with his new found powers freezes heimdall] then i need no longer obey you. [when they notice the giant killer robot loki has sent to destroy them]
thor,"jane, you have to leave."
jane foster,what are you gonna do?
thor,im staying here.
fandral,thor is gonna fight with us.
thor,"[to fandral, volstagg, sif and hogun] my friends, im just a man. ill only be in the way, or worse get one of you killed. but i can help get these people to safety."
jane foster,"well, if youre staying, then so am i."
thor,well need some time.
fandral,youll have it.
darcy lewis,"[as they others move away to help the people around them] okay, move it people! [after sif and the others have failed to destroy lokis giant killer robot]"
thor,"sif, youve done all you can."
sif,no! i will die a warrior death! stories will be told of this day.
thor,"live, and tell those stories yourself. [she cries in defeat] now, go! [walking towards lokis giant killer robot] brother, whatever i have done to wrong you, whatever i have done to lead you to do this, i am truly sorry! but these people are innocent. taking their lives will gain you nothing. so take mine and end this. [the giant killer robots turns off his fire weapon and just as he turns to go he hits thor hard] [flashback to odin whispering to thors hammer before he banishes it from asgard]"
odin,"whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of thor. [as thor lies dying from the impact of being hit by lokis killer robot, his hammer rises from where it was embedded in the stone and finds thor to save him] [after thor has regained his powers and is wearing his warrior costume with the red cape]"
jane foster,so is this how you normally look?
thor,more or less.
jane foster,its a good look!
agent coulson,"[walking towards thor, whos dressed in his asgardian warrior costume] donald, i dont think youve been completely honest with me."
thor,"know this, son of coul. you and i, we fight for the same cause; the protection of this world. from this day forward you can count me as your ally, if, you return the items you have taken from jane."
jane foster,stolen!
thor,borrowed. [coulson pauses from a moment before continuing] of course you can have your equipment back. youre gonna need it to continue your research. would you like to see the bridge we spoke of?
jane foster,uh...sure. [he pulls jane close to him and then flies with her in his arms towards the clouds]
thor,"i must go back to asgard. but i give you my word, i will return for you. [he takes her and kisses it] deal? [she suddenly kisses him passionately]"
jane foster,deal. [opening one of odins eyes as he sleeps]
king laufey,"its said, you can still hear and see what transpires around you. i hope its true, so that you may know your death came at the hand of laufey. [just as hes about to strike and kill odin, he gets strike down by loki from behind]"
loki,and your death came by the son of odin.
frigga,"[referring to loki saving odin from being killed by laufey] loki, you saved him. [she embraces loki]"
loki,"i swear to you mother, that they will pay for what they have done today. [just then thor shows up]"
thor,loki!
frigga,thor! i knew youd return to us. [she runs towards him and embraces him]
thor,why dont you tell her? how you sent the destroyer to kill our friends! to kill me!
frigga,what?
loki,"well, i must have been enforcing fathers last command."
thor,"youre a talented lier, brother. always have been."
loki,"its good to have you back. now, if youll excuse me, i have to destroy jotunheim."
thor,why have you done this?
loki,"to prove to father, that i am a worthy son! when he wakes, i will have saved his life. i will have destroyed that race of monsters. and i will be true heir to the throne!"
thor,you cant kill an entire race!
loki,why not? and what is this new found love for the frost giants? you? who could have killed them all with your bear hands.
thor,ive changed.
loki,"so have i. [he hits thor in the face with his spear] now, fight me? [he hits thor harder, making him fall] i never wanted the throne! i only ever wanted to be your equal."
thor,"[shouting] i will not fight you, brother!"
loki,im not your brother. i never was!
thor,"loki, this is madness!"
loki,"is it madness? is it? is it? come on, what happened to you on earth that turned you so soft? dont tell me it was that woman? [thor give him a look of anger] oh! it was! well, maybe when were finished here, ill pay here a visit myself. [angrily thor suddenly charges towards him] [to thor as he struggles to get close to the bifrost to stop it from destroying jotunheim] look at you? the mighty thor! with all your strength! and what good does it do you now? [thor keeps on struggling forward] [shouting] do you hear me, brother? theres nothing you can do! [after thor has destroyed the bridge, odin whos awakened, holds onto thor and loki hanging from the bridge] i could have done it, father! i could have done it! for you! for all of us!"
odin,"no, loki. [loki looking dismayed loosens his grip on odins spear]"
thor,"loki, no! [he lets go and falls, disappearing into the darkness and the stars] [shouting] noooo!"
odin,no.
sif,"my queen, im so sorry for your loss. [referring to thor] how is he?"
frigga,"he mourns for his brother. and...he misses her, the mortal."
odin,youll be a wise king.
thor,"there will never be a wiser king than you. nor a better father. i have much to learn. i know that now. someday, perhaps, i shall make you proud."
odin,"youve already made me proud. [last lines; thor approaches heimdall, whos standing by the edge of the broken bridge]"
thor,so earth is lost to us?
heimdall,no. there is always hope.
thor,can you see her?
heimdall,"yes. [we see jane, erik and darcy as they get ready to out on one of their field researchs]"
thor,how is she?
heimdall,she searches for you. [lines after end of credits]
nick fury,doctor selvig?
erik selvig,"so, youre the man behind all this? [he walks towards fury] its quite a labyrinth. i was thinking, theyre taking me down here to kill me. [he laughs]"
nick fury,ive been hearing about the new mexico situation. your work has impressed a lot of people who are much smarter than i am.
erik selvig,"i have a lot to work with. the forster theory, a gate to another dimension. its unprecedented. isnt it?"
nick fury,"legend tell us one thing, history another. but every now and then we find something that belongs to both. [he opens a metal case to reveal the casket odin had taken from jotunheim]"
nick fury,"power, doctor. if we can figure out how to tap it, maybe unlimited power. [as we see eriks reflection in the nearby glass, we see loki appear behind him not visible to anyone else]"
loki,"[whispering] well, i guess thats worth a look. [erik repeats lokis words]"
erik selvig,"well, i guess thats worth a look."
