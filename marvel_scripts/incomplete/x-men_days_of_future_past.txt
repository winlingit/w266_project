*[New York - mutants and the humans have been gathered by an army of robots to be killed]
*'''Professor X''': (Voice Over) The future, a dark, desolate world. A world of war, suffering, loss on both sides. Mutants, and the humans who dared to help them, fighting an enemy we cannot defeat. [a young mutant is seen walking through piles of dirt and carcasses] Are we destined down this path? Destined to destroy ourselves like so many species before us? Or can we evolve fast enough to change ourselves, change our fate?
*[the mutant kneels down and brushes off some dirt on the ground from an object with the Mutant Academy's X on it. Suddenly there's a low rumbling noise, and as the mutant turns to see what it is a light is flashed across the mutant's face]
*'''Professor X: '''Is the future truly set?
*[cue Main Titles]
*[in Moscow a mutant, Warpath, spots several pods carrying robots and dropping them near the building they're ransacking]
*'''Warpath''': They're here!
*[he joins another mutant, Blink. Using her powers she opens a portal to transport them to the lower level to warn their fellow mutants: Colossus, Sunspot, Bishop and Kitty Pryde]
*'''Blink''': Time's up.
*'''Sunspot''': Sentinels!
*'''Bishop''': Sunspot!
*[Sunspot uses his power to create solar power energy which Bishop uses with his powers to absorb and power up his weapon]
*'''Kitty''': Let's go.
*[Bishop and Kitty start running and Kitty uses her power so that she and Bishop can phases through walls as the others wait to fight the Sentinels. When they arrive the team of mutants begin to fight the Sentinels. Bobby/Iceman also arrives to join them, but the Sentinels kill them all by latching onto the mutants to adapt to their powers, copying them and use their powers against them]
*'''Warpath''': Run!
*'''Blink''': Go!
*[Kitty takes Bishop into a vault and starts to create a link with his consciousness. At the same time Blink goes to help Warpath fight the Sentinels when one of them strikes her down]
*'''Warpath''': Blink! No!
*[she falls and dies. The remaining Sentinels quickly kill Warpath as he tries to protect the vault, and one of the Sentinels breaks into the vault]
*'''Kitty''': Too late, assholes.
*[just as the Sentinel is about to kill Bishop and Kitty they disappear as they are transported out of there]
*'''Guard''': Don't move, you mutant scum!
*'''Guy''': No!
*'''Guard''': Flat on the ground, hands behind your head!
*[Professor X is using his powers to find other mutants]
*'''Professor X''': (Voice Over) So few of us left.
*'''Kitty''': Professor?
*'''Professor X''': I've found them.
*[an X-Jet descends in China to where Professor X, Storm, Logan and Magneto dismount at a monastery, they are met by Bishop, Sunspot and Warpath, who are both alive]
*'''Bobby''': Professor!
*[then we see Bobby, who is also alive]
*'''Storm''': Bobby.
*'''Bobby''': Hey, Storm.
*[they embrace]
*'''Wolverine''': Hey, kid.
*[Bobby nods his head to Logan]
*'''Kitty''': Professor, you made it.
*[she joins them along with Colossus, who is also alive]
*'''Kitty: '''Whenever the Sentinels attack, Warpath spots them... then I send Bishop back to warn us of the attack before it happens. Blink scouts the exit site... and then we leave before they ever know we were there.
*'''Warpath''': Because... we never were.
*'''Wolverine''': What do you mean you were never there?
*'''Professor X''': She projects Bishop back in time a few days to warn the others... of the coming attack.
*'''Wolverine''': So she needs Bishop back in time?
*'''Professor X''': No, just his consciousness, into his younger self. His younger body.
*'''Wolverine''': Wow.
*'''Magneto''': This might just work, Charles.
*'''Kitty''': What might work?
*'''Professor X''': The Sentinel program was originally conceived by Doctor Bolivar Trask. In the early '70's, he was one of the world's leading weapons designers. But, covertly, he had begun experimenting on mutants... using their gifts to fuel his own research.
*'''Trask(flashback):''' This is extraordinary.
*'''Professor X:''' There was one mutant who has discovered what he was doing.
*'''Magneto''': A mutant with the ability to transform herself into anyone.
*'''Colossus''': Mystique.
*'''Professor X''': I knew her as Raven. We me when we were children, grew up together. She was like a sister to me. I tried to help her... but only succeeded in driving her away. She haunted Trask across the world. And at the Paris Peace Accords in 1973, after the Vietnam War, she found Trask... and killed him. It was the first time she killed.
*'''Wolverine''': It wasn't her last.
*'''Professor X''': But killing Trask did not have the outcome she expected. It only persuaded the government of the need for his program. They captured her that day... tortured her, experimented on her. In her DNA, they discovered the secrets to her powers of transformation. It gave them the key they needed, to create weapons that could adapt to any mutant power. And in less than 50 years, the machines that have destroyed so many of our kind were created. But it all started that day in 1973, the day she first killed, the day she truly became... Mystique.
*'''Kitty''': You want to go back there.
*'''Professor X''': If I can get to her, stop the assassination... keep her out off their hands... then we can stop the Sentinels from ever being born.
*'''Magneto''': And end this war before it ever begins.
*'''Kitty''': Uh, I can send someone back a couple weeks. Maybe a month. But you're talking about going back decades. You have the the most powerful brain in the world, Professor... but the mind can only stretch so far before it snaps. It would you rip apart. I'm sorry. No one could survive that trip.
*'''Wolverine''': What if someone's mind has a way of snapping back? What if someone can heal as fast as they're ripped apart?
*[outside the monastery as they prepare to protect Logan as he goes back in time]
*'''Storm''': Okay, spread out.
*'''Bishop''': Take your positions.
*[Being prepped for time travel inside the monastery, while the remaining X-Men and the Free Mutants lead by Bishop and Warpath stand guard outside keeping a look out for Sentinels.]
*'''Wolverine''': So I wake up in my younger body, God knows where. Then what?
*'''Professor X''': You'll need to go to my house and find me. Convince me of all of this.
*'''Wolverine''': Won't you be able to just read my mind?
*'''Professor X''': I didn't have my powers in 1973. Logan, you're going to have to do for me what I once did for you. Lead me, guide me. I was a very different man then. You'll have to be patient with me.
*'''Wolverine''': Patience is my strongest suit.
*'''Magneto''': You'll need me as well.
*'''Wolverine''': What?
*'''Magneto''': After Mystique left Charles, she came with me... and I set her on a dangerous path. A darker path. It's going to take the two of us, side by side... at a time when we couldn't be further apart.
*[Professor X agrees with Magneto.]
*'''Wolverine''': Great. So where do I find you?
*'''Magneto''': Well, it's complicated.
*[Logan is lying down as Kitty prepares him]
*'''Kitty''': Basically, your body will go to sleep. While your mind travels back in time. As long as you're back there, past and present will continue to coexist. But you once wake up... whatever you've done will take hold and become history. And for the rest of us, it will be the only history that we know. It will be like the last that 50 years never happened. And this world, and this war... the only person who remember it is you. All right, Logan... I need you to clear your head and to stay as calm as possible.
*'''Wolverine''': What? What do you mean?
*'''Kitty''': If your mind gets rocky, it will be harder for me to hold you... and you could start to slip between past and future.
*'''Wolverine''': What if I need to get a little rocky?
*'''Kitty''': Think peaceful thoughts?
*'''Wolverine''': Peaceful thoughts... Do you have any good news?
*'''Kitty''': Well, you don't really age, so you'll pretty much look the same.
*'''Bobby''': You won't have much the time in the past. The Sentinels will find us. They always do.
*'''Kitty''': And this time, we won't be able to run. We'll have no escape. This is our last chance!
*'''Magneto''': You really think this work?
*'''Professor X''': I have faith in him. It's not him I'm worried about, it's us.
*'''Magneto''': We were young... we didn't know any better.
*'''Professor X''': We will now.
*'''Wolverine''': See you all soon.
*'''Kitty''': This might sting a little.
*[as Kitty forms the link to Logan's consciousness he yells out in pain and his claws extend]
*'''Wolverine''': (Screaming)
*[Logan wakes up in 1973 and the first thing he sees is a lava lamp, he finds himself lying naked in a waterbed next to a woman, he rises and goes to look at himself in the mirror, then looks out the window to see a busy city in 70's]
*'''Past Wolverine''': Whoa. Holy shit. It worked. Hey, what's going on?
*'''Ramone''': Gwen get dressed.
*'''Past Wolverine''': Who the hell are you? Hey, I don't know what's going on.
*'''Ramone''': What's going on you're supposed to be guarding the boss's daughter not screwing her.
*'''Past Wolverine''': Well, I didn't sleep with her.
*'''Ramone''': No?
*'''Past Wolverine''': No. I mean, yes, I slept with her many times.
*'''Gwen''': Jimmy!
*'''Past Wolverine''': That wasn't me. That was the old me. I just got here 20 seconds ago.
*'''Ramone''': Really? Then what happened to your clothes?
*'''Past Wolverine''': My... Oh. Would you believe me if I told you I was sent here from the future?
*'''Gwen''': Huh?
*'''Ramone''': Get out of here, sweetheart.
*'''Past Wolverine''': Yeah.
*'''Ramone''': We're gonna take care of this comedian.
*'''Past Wolverine''': No, you're not. You're gonna give me the keys to your car and some money for gas... or you're gonna wake me up in the hospital. Trust me, I know how these things play out.
*'''Ramone''': Oh. Because you're from the future?
*'''Past Wolverine''': No. Because of these. What the hell? God damn it!
*[Logan takes them all down]
*'''Past Wolverine: '''Peaceful thoughts.
*[in Washington D.C., Trask is meeting with Congress to lobby his Sentinel program]
*'''Senator Brickman''': We are reviewing all of our defense expenditures... and all the black books are being opened. We can't support a weapon that targets our own citizens. If these mutants as you describe... are already living among us... then they are living here peacefully. We haven't had an incident in over 10 years.
*'''Senator Parker''': After what happened in Cuba? That was never confirmed. [Addressing Trask] We have very real enemies out there: The Russians, the Chinese.
*'''Senator Brickman''': We are talking about a tenth of a tenth... of a tenth population.
*'''Dr. Trask''': Allow me to read something to you.
*'''Senator Parker''': Please.
*'''Dr. Trask''': This was acquired by our friends at the CIA. [Opening a folder] It's a dissertation written by a mutant at Oxford University and I quote "To Homo Neanderthalensis, his mutant cousin: Homo Sapiens, which is us, was an aberration. The arrival of the mutated human species, Homo Sapiens, was followed by the immediate extinction of their less evolved kin." [Closes the folder] Well, now we are the Neanderthal.
*[Members of Congress laugh quietly]
*'''Senator Brickman''': Speak for yourself, Dr. Trask.
*[there's a low chuckle by Trask and some of the congressmen]
*'''Dr. Trask''': [Warning Congress] You know, when you sent our soldiers to Vietnam without the weapons they needed to win the war, you underestimated your enemy. You do that with this enemy and it won't be some border skirmish halfway around the world. This time, the war will be for our streets, our cities, our homes. By the time you see the need for my program, it'll be too late and you'll have lost two wars in one lifetime.
*'''Senator Brickman''': [Believing Trask is insane and paranoid] We're sorry Dr. Trask, but your Sentinel Program it ain't going to fly!
*[Saigon - Colonel Sanders arrives at a quarantined tent guarded by MP's]
*'''Soldier''': Can I help you, Colonel?
*'''Colonel''': Just here to give our boys a proper send-off.
*'''Soldier''': I'm sorry, sir, but we have orders. This is a quarantined area.
*'''Colonel''': Stand aside, solider. That's an order. [the guards stand aside and open the doors to let Sanders through to the tent]
*'''Soldier''': Atten-hut!
*[the soldiers all rise]
*'''Colonel''': At ease. [as Sanders walks through the tent he looks at the mutant soldiers, he notices Alex Summers/Havok and winks at him, Alex looks at him with confusion, Strand goes over the doctor who's collecting blood samples] What's all this?
*'''Soldier''': Lab reports, blood tests. It's all getting packing up and shipped back.
*'''Colonel''': Where is it going?
*'''Soldier''': Same place they are. Trask Industries.
*[Major William Stryker enters the tent]
*'''Stryker''': Let's go, gentlemen. I'm taking you out of this shit show.
*'''Havok''': Shipping home?
*'''Stryker''': Not just yet.
*[another solider opens a case containing vials of drugs]
*'''Toad''': What are you doing with those?
*'''Stryker''': Something to make the ride a little smoother. I'm transferring you to a private facility... where we can run a few more tests.
*[as the soldier prepares the injection Sanders walks over to Stryker]
*'''Colonel''': Your men are not military.
*'''Stryker''': Private outfit. [Stryker gives Sanders his paperwork] We're authorized to remand these men.
*'''Colonel''': [Sanders looks at the papers] Hmm. These troops are going home.
*'''Stryker''': Well, Colonel, I don't believe you have jurisdiction in this matter.
*'''Colonel''': I'm afraid I do, son.
*'''Stryker''': I'm sorry, who are you?
*[Sanders turns Stryker's dog tags around to look at his name]
*'''Colonel''': The question is, Major... ...who are you?
*[suddenly Sanders turns into Mystique, she and the other mutants take down the soldiers]
*[as Stryker goes to grab his gun, Raven grabs hold of his throat and nearly strangles him]
*'''Havok''': Raven!
*'''Mystique''': That's not my name. [before Raven kills Stryker Alex uses his power to release a plasma blast at Stryker who gets knocked out] I had that.
*'''Havok''': I know.
*'''Mystique''': Let's move out. Come on, let's go.
*'''Havok''': Where's Erik?
*'''Mystique''': I'm on my own now.
*[as they walk out of the tent Raven has disguised herself by turning into Sanders again]
*'''Soldier''': Let's go! Move it!
*'''Colonel''': [Raven disguised as Sanders guides the mutant soldiers towards a plane which is about to take off] Hold that plane! [to the soldiers boarding the plane] Wouldn't wanna leave these boys in this god for saken country.
*'''Soldier''': Yes, sir.
*'''Havok''': You're not coming with us, are you?
*'''Colonel''': My war's not over. The enemy is still out there.
*'''Stryker''': [as Alex boards the plane, Sanders starts walking away and then transforms into Raven dressed in military clothes, at the same time Stryker walks out of the tent to look for them] Where did they go? [to the MP guards] The four privates, where did they go?
*'''Soldier''': They were headed towards the tarmac.
*[Stryker heads towards the tarmac and watches in frustration as the plane takes off]
*[Wolverine arrives at the X-Mansion which looks abandoned and run down, he notices the sign for Xavier School fallen on the ground, he drives to the front door, gets out of his car and knocks on the front door which is opened by Hank McCoy / Beast]
*'''Hank''': Can I help you?
*'''Past Wolverine''': Uh... Yeah, what happened to the school?
*'''Hank''': The school's been shut for years. Are you a parent?
*'''Past Wolverine''':[scoffs] I sure as hell hope not. Who are you?
*'''Hank''': I'm Hank. Hank McCoy. I look after the house now.
*'''Past Wolverine''': [smiles] You're Beast? Look at you. I guess you're a late bloomer.
*'''Hank''': I don't know what you're talking about, but I'm gonna ask you to leave. [tries to shut the door]
*'''Past Wolverine''': [pushes against door] So where's the Professor?
*'''Hank''': There's no professor here.
*'''Past Wolverine''': [as Logan keeps pushing against the door and Hank pushes back to close it] You're pretty strong for a scrawny kid. You sure there's not a little Beast in there?
*'''Hank''': [struggling] No, he's not here.
*'''Past Wolverine''': Come on, Beast. Come on, Beastie.
*'''Hank''': No. [gives way as Logan bursts through door] [Logan finally manages to push through the door and enter the house] [as Logan pushes past Hank and enters X-Mansion] Hey! Is said the school's closed. You need to leave.
*'''Past Wolverine''': Not until I see the Professor.
*'''Hank''': [Hank grabs Logan by his shoulder and turns him round] There's no Professor here, I told you that.
*'''Past Wolverine''': [To Hank] Look, kid. You and I gonna be good friends... [suddenly Logan punches Hank in the face making him fall to the ground] [Hank watches in pain as Logan goes to search for the Professor] Professor! [Hank looking angry, Hank turns into his Beast form] [Logan walks through a corridor] Professor!
*'''Beast''': (Roars)
*[Suddenly Hank in his Beat form attacks Logan and throws him down the stairs, he hangs on the chandelier ready to strike Logan when they are interrupted by young Charles Xavier]
*'''Young Charles''': Hank? What's going on here?
*[Logan watches as Charles walks down the stairs, wearing his dressing gown and looking disheveled]
*'''Past Wolverine''': Professor?
*'''Young Charles''': Please don't call me that.
*'''Beast''': Why? You know this guy?
*'''Young Charles''': Yeah, he looks sightly familiar. Get off the bloody chandelier, Hank.
*[Hank dismounts from the chandelier]
*'''Past Wolverine''': You can walk?
*'''Young Charles''': You're a perceptive one.
*'''Past Wolverine''': I thought Erik...
*'''Young Charles''': Which makes it slightly perplexing that you missed our sign on the way in. This is private property, my friend. I'm gonna have to ask him to ask you to leave.
*'''Past Wolverine''': Well. I'm afraid I can't do that... because I was sent here for you.
*'''Young Charles''': Well, tell whoever it was sent you that I'm busy.
*'''Past Wolverine''': That's gonna be a little tricky... because the person who sent me was you.
*'''Young Charles''': What?
*'''Past Wolverine''': About 50 years from now.
*'''Young Charles''': Like in the future, 50 years from now?
*'''Past Wolverine''': Yeah.
*'''Young Charles''': I sent you from the future?
*'''Past Wolverine''': Yeah.
*'''Young Charles''': Piss off.
*'''Past Wolverine''': If you had powers, you'd know I was telling the truth.
*'''Young Charles''': How do you know I don't have p... Who are you?
*'''Past Wolverine''': I told you.
*'''Young Charles''': Are you CIA?
*'''Past Wolverine''': No.
*'''Young Charles''': You've been watching me?
*'''Past Wolverine''': I know you, Charles. We've been friends for years. I know your powers came when you were 9. I know you thought you were going crazy when it started... all the voices in your head. And it wasn't until you were 12... that you realized all the voices were in everyone else's head. Do you want me to go on?
*[Charles looks confused and shocked]
*'''Young Charles''': I never told anyone that.
*'''Past Wolverine''': No, yet, no, but, you will.
*'''Young Charles''': All right, you've piqued my interest. What do you want?
*'''Past Wolverine''': We have to stop Raven. I need your help. We need your help.
*'''Young Charles''': [emotional] I think I'd like to wake up now. [walks away]
*[Charles walks turns and walks into the next room]
*'''Hank''': [To Logan] What does she have to do with this?
*[Logan watches as Hank turns back into his human form]
*'''Young Charles''': So you're saying... they took Raven's power, and what? They weaponized it?
*'''Past Wolverine''': Yep.
*'''Hank''': She is unique.
*'''Young Charles''': Yeah, she is, Hank.
*'''Past Wolverine''': In the beginning the Sentinels were just targeting mutants, then they began to identify the genetics in non-mutants who'd eventually have mutant children or grandchildren. Then they started targeting everybody. Many of the humans tried to help us, it was a slaughter. Leaving only the worst of humanity in charge. I've been in a lot of wars, I've never seen anything like this. And it all starts with her.
*'''Young Charles''': Let's just say for the sake of... the sake, that I choose to believe you... that I choose to help you. Raven won't listen to me. Her heat and soul belong to someone else now.
*'''Past Wolverine''': I know. That's why we're gonna need Magneto, too.
*'''Young Charles''': Erik?
*'''Hank''': You do know where Erik is?
*'''Past Wolverine''': Yeah.
*[Charles laughs harder then starts to walk out of the room]
*'''Young Charles''': He's where he belongs.
*'''Past Wolverine''': You're just gonna walk out?
*'''Young Charles''': Ooh, top marks. Like I said, you are perceptive.
*'''Past Wolverine''': The Professor I know would never turn his back... on someone who'd lost their path. Especially someone he loved.
*'''Young Charles''': [To Logan] You know, I think I do remember you now. Yeah... We came to you a long time ago seeking your help. And I'm gonna say to you [[X-Men: First Class|what you said to us then]]: Fuck off!
*[Logan angrily grabs hold of Charles]
*'''Past Wolverine''': Listen to me, you little shit. I've come a long way, and I've watched a lot of people die. Good people. Friends. If you're gonna wallow in self-pity... and do nothing, then you're gonna watch the same thing... you understand?
*[Logan let's go of Charles]
*'''Young Charles''': We all have to die sometime.
*[Charles turns and walks off and goes back up stairs to his room]
*'''Hank''': Told you there's no professor here.
*'''Past Wolverine''': What the hell happened to him?
*'''Hank''': He lost everything. Erik, Raven... his legs. We built this school, the labs, this whole place... then, just after the first semester... the war in Vietnam got worse. Many of the teachers... and older students were drafted. It broke him. He retreated himself. I wanted to help, do something... so I designed a serum to treat his spine... derived from the same formula that helps me control my mutation. I take just enough to keep myself balanced... but he takes too much. I tried easing him back... but he just couldn't bear the pain, the voices. The treatment gives him his legs... but its not enough. He's... He's just lost too much.
*[in his room, after he's taken another shot of Hank's serum, Charles has flashback to when he first met Raven when they were children]
*'''Young Raven''': You're not scared of me?
*'''Young Charles''': I always believed I couldn't be the only one in the world. Charles Xavier.
*'''Young Raven''': Raven.
*'''Young Charles''': You're hungry and alone. Take whatever you want. We've got lots of food. You don't have to steal. In fact... you never have to steal again. And that's a promise.
*[Charles joins Hank and Logan again]
*'''Young Charles''': I'll help you get her. Not for any of your future shite, but for her.
*'''Past Wolverine''': Fair enough.
*'''Young Charles''': But I'll tell you this. You don't know Erik. That man is a monster. A murderer. You think you can convice Raven to change? To come home? That's splendid. But what makes you thibk you can change him?
*'''Past Wolverine''': Because you and Erik sent me back together.
*[we see Erik being held in a prison cell beneath the Pentagon]
*'''Hank''': The room they're holding him in was built during the Second World War... when there was a shortage of steel. So the foundation is pure concrete and sand. No metal.
*'''Young Charles''': He's being held... a hundred floors beneath the most heavily guarded building the planet.
*'''Past Wolverine''': Why is he in there?
*'''Young Charles''': What, he forgot to mention?
*'''Hank''': Uh, JFK.
*'''Past Wolverine''': he killed...
*'''Young Charles''': What else explains a bullet miraculously curving through the air? Erik's always had a way with guns. Are you sure you want to carry on with this?
*'''Young Charles''': This is your plan, not mine.
*'''Hank''': We don't have any resources to get us in.
*'''Young Charles''': Or out. It's just me and Hank.
*'''Past Wolverine''': I know a guy. Yeah, he'd be a young man now. Grew up outside of D.C. He could get into anywhere. I just don't know how the hell we're gonna find him.
*[Hank looks at Charles]
*'''Hank''': Is Cerebro of the question? [Charles looks down] We have a phonebook.
*[in the evening at Trask Industries Trask walks through to get to his office]
*'''Sectary''': I thought you'd be getting ready for your trip, sir?
*'''Dr. Trask''': I just came to grab a couple files. Is that a new scarf? It's nice.
*'''Sectary''': Thank you. Dr. Trask?
*[As Trask walks up the stairs we see him transform in to Raven, she starts looking through his desk drawers but finds nothing, she notices a large painting of Trask behind his desk and finds a hidden safe under it, she manages to gain access and enters to find his personal files, including blueprints for the Sentinels, as well as autopsy reports on the mutants he's experimented on including her former friends Azazel and Angel Salvadore, as tears roll down her face Trask's secretary suddenly comes into Trask's office]
*'''Mystique''': [speaking in Trask's voice] Once second.
*[Mystique now transformed into Trask again steps out of the safe]
*'''Sectary''': [she hands him a piece of paper] Oh. We added some names to the Paris meeting.
*'''Dr. Trask''': Thank you. [she looks at Trask and notices the tear rolling down his face]
*'''Sectary''': Is something wrong, sir?
*'''Dr. Trask''': [Trask quickly wipes the tear from his face]No. It's nothing. [Trask quickly wipes the tear from his face] Would you mind trying up my itinerary? I don't wanna miss anything. [his secretary nods her head, turns and walks off]
*[Logan, Charles and Hank drive up to Peter Maximoff/Quicksilver's home, a mutant with superhuman speed]
*'''Past Wolverine''': Here, here, here.
*'''Young Charles''': Where?
*'''Past Wolverine''': Just stop here.
*'''Young Charles''': All right, all right.
*'''Past Wolverine''': Next time I'm driving.
*'''Young Charles''': Don't get used to it.
*[they get of the car and walk over to the front door, Logan knocks on the door and his mother answers the door]
*'''Ms. Maximoff''': What's he done now? I just write you a check for whatever he took.
*'''Past Wolverine''': We just need to talk to him.
*[she lets them enter]
*'''Ms. Maximoff''': Peter! The cops are here. Again.
*[the three walk down to the basement where Peter is playing table tennis with himself using his powers of speed]
*'''Quicksilver''': What do you guys want? I didn't do anything. [suddenly he sits down on the couch] I've been here all day.
*'''Past Wolverine''': Just relax, Peter. We're not Cops.
*'''Quicksilver''': Of course you're not. If you were, you wouldn't be driving a rental car.
*'''Young Charles''': How did you know we've got a rental car?
*'''Quicksilver''': I checked your registration when you were walking to the door. I also had some time to kill so I went through your rental agreement. Saw you were from out of town. Are you FBI? [using his power he quickly swipes Charles' wallet and looks at Charles' card] No, you're not cops. Hey, what's with his gifted youngsters place? [he drops the card and wallet to the floor]
*'''Young Charles''': That's an old card.
*'''Hank''': He's fascinating.
*'''Young Charles''': He's a pain in the arise.
*'''Hank''': What, a teleporter?
*'''Past Wolverine''': No, he just fast. And when I knew him he wasn't so... young.
*'''Quicksilver''': Young? You're just old.
*
