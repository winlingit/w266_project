Seated at a desk in the center of the room is MAX LENSHERR - age - somewhere after sixty, but strong and vital for his years. He is more often called MAGNETO. The clicking is from the sound of an executive pendulum thingy on his desk. The six steel balls hang onto one another from string supports in formation depending on how many are let to fly from either end. One ball strikes one and one ball swings out from the other. Two balls and two, and so on. Slight difference. There are no strings supporting the balls, thus defying gravity.
